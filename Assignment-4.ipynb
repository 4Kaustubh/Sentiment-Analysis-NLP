Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d\\n\\u266a A whole new world \\u266a\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore.\\nI\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d\\nI can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

[crowd chuckles] And also, to my friends over at La Carreta for all the food. So\\u2026\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYes. [laughing] Yeah, man. Before we get started, you guys, uh, I would like to thank the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino for the opportunity to record a special. No other entertainer has done a special here yet. Tonight is the first one.\\n[crowd cheering]\\nIt wasn\\u2019t the Rolling Stones. It wasn\\u2019t the Eagles. They trusted a comedian\\u2026 [crowd cheers] \\u2026to make this happen. So I wanna say thank you. Is anybody else staying here at the, uh\\u2026 at the Hard Rock? [crowd cheers] Hey, me too.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a beautiful hotel, and I\\u2019m not just saying that \\u2019cause my room is free. [audience laughs] You know you\\u2019re in a nice hotel and casino when you turn on your TV in your room and they have their own video. Like, if you\\u2019re staying here, you turn on the TV, you get this, [trills tongue] [feminine voice] \\u201cWelcome to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [moans seductively] \\u201cTwenty-four-hour gambling, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\\u201d [moans suggestively] I\\u2019m sitting there like, \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t I stop watching this?\\u201d And I started thinking, at this point, why don\\u2019t they just do that to the slot machines? You know? Gambling\\u2019s already shameless. Might as well go all the way. You walk up to one of the little machines, pop in a 20. [whirring] [moans loudly] [whirring, moans] [feminine voice] \\u201cDon\\u2019t stop.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [audience laughs] People are walking by. \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cTrying to get the jackpot!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] Yeah, man. I\\u2019m gonna start the show off tonight with a question. That\\u2019s not how comedy shows happen, but I\\u2019m gonna start it with a question. The question is, who here tonight has never heard of me up until tonight? [scattered cheering] Five. Two. Five. Okay. To those of you, the five of you, I say, \\u201cSorry.\\u201d I know you got excited. You saw the ticket. You saw the last name, and then I walked out. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cEnrique got bigger.\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why I ask who has never seen or heard of me before is because if you have, then you know the type of show that I do. And you know the type of show that I don\\u2019t do. Like, I\\u2019m not here to tell you who to vote for, who not to vote for, what shot to take or what baby to get rid of. That\\u2019s not for me to say. If you\\u2019re already offended, you missed the point. I\\u2019m telling you what I\\u2019m not gonna do. I promise you, I am here to entertain, not offend. Okay? [audience cheers] We\\u2019re gonna have fun with everybody. Starting with me, but I\\u2019m gonna let you know, we\\u2019re living in a different time. I\\u2019ve been doing this so long, I always figured, as long as I\\u2019m being nice, I shouldn\\u2019t have any issues, but it\\u2019s a very different time. This is year 27 for me.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYeah. Twenty-seven years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I never had to worry. You know, when I first got started, shoot\\u2026 1997, I was clean-shaven, I had hair. I know. Look at some of you. \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d Huh? Vaccine. I know. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kid\\u2026 I\\u2019m kidding. Sorry, Florida. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kidding. I said \\u201cVaccine,\\u201d some of you were like, \\u201cI told you!\\u201d Yeah. [crowd laughs] [in Spanish] \\u201cI told you. He said so.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [in English] Some friends tell me, \\u201cDude, man, you\\u2019re making money now. Why don\\u2019t you get the hair thingy?\\u201d I said, \\u201cFor what?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, some women, they want a guy with hair.\\u201d Well, good for them.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd they\\u2019re not lying. I have gone out with some women that made it a point to tell me that hair was important. One told me flat out, \\u201cI need to be able to run my fingers through your hair.\\u201d Yeah! And I told her, \\u201cHey, look, if you go deep enough\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026you\\u2019re gonna get your wish.\\u201d \\u201cYou were not specific on location. Hey.\\u201d \\u201cYou want hair, you want pelos, I got you.\\u201d But, yeah, 27 years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I have seen a lot of comedians come and go. And I feel very grateful that in all that time, we\\u2019ve still managed to maintain a certain level.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo I feel like we\\u2019re doing something right. Which feels weird to me, because now I feel like you gotta be very mindful. Okay? You gotta be extra mindful. Like\\u2026 Uh, 27 years of being a comedian, I finally started hearing people tell me things that I\\u2019ve never heard before. I started hearing people tell me things like, \\u201cHey, Fluffy. I grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience chuckles] Which is an incredible compliment because that doesn\\u2019t just say that you\\u2019re a fan, that says that you\\u2019re invested. That says that you\\u2019ve been following this career for a very long time. Some of you, the first time you saw me perform, you were kids. [audience cheers] And now some of you are here tonight with your kids. [audience cheers] And so, I just want to say thank you for all those years of trust and continuing to come back to see the show. It means a lot. [audience cheers and applauds] Hearing someone say they grew up watching me, that is one of the most beautiful compliments any entertainer can receive. And I understand that now, with therapy, that that\\u2019s what that means.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nLook, I\\u2019m not gonna lie. The first time I heard someone tell me that they grew up watching me, I didn\\u2019t know how to handle it. I didn\\u2019t know how to process because nobody wants to feel like they\\u2019re getting\\u2026 old. The first time I heard it, I was like\\u2026 [gasps dramatically] Second time I heard it, I was like, \\u201cBuy a hat.\\u201d The third time, I accepted it. I was like, [as old white man\\u2019] \\u201cMany years ago, when I first got started, all of this was land as far as the eye could see.\\u201d \\u201cIt was a very different time, and\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I don\\u2019t know why my old voice is white. [audience laughs] He just is. I tried doing the Mexican voice, but you don\\u2019t take him as serious. [in Spanish] \\u201cWell, screw you.\\u201d \\u201cWe were at the ranch, and were told to fuck off, dude.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s very tough out there.\\u201d [in English] But times are changing. The rules are changing. So I don\\u2019t know how much longer this is gonna be okay. I\\u2019ll tell you what happened to me and why I brought that up. I did a podcast. And before I went into the studio, I\\u2019m talking to the producer outside. And the producer\\u2019s excited and happy, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGabriel Iglesias, we\\u2019re so excited to have you.\\u201d \\u201cThis is really cool.\\u201d \\u201cBefore you go in, the host wanted me to ask you something before you go in for your interview.\\u201d I go, \\u201cSure, go for it.\\u201d \\u201cOkay. What do you identify as?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I wasn\\u2019t sure how to answer that. I\\u2019m 47 years old. I didn\\u2019t know what to say. I was like, \\u201cShit. Hungry, I guess.\\u201d\\nI mean\\u2026\\n[audience laughs] I\\u2019m tired, sleepy, depressed on Tuesdays. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to say. See, here\\u2019s the thing. I knew what she was trying to ask me. I just wasn\\u2019t trying to get involved in a conversation about something that has absolutely nothing to do with me. This was\\u2026 Yeah. [audience cheers] I felt like I was being baited because no matter how I answered that question, I was gonna find myself in an awkward situation. So you know, because for me, I was just like, \\u201cLet me just be funny.\\u201d But nowadays, you can\\u2019t just not answer the question because silence is seen as a problem. And I\\u2019m sorry if me not answering a certain question is considered a problem. I was brought up during a time where you were constantly told to mind your business.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s all I\\u2019m trying to do is stay in my lane. Another thing we were constantly told was always respect your elders. [audience cheers] And no matter what generation you were from, that was at least the one thing we could always agree on until now. Now older people are seen as a problem. They are. You know, and I understand the youth of today has the technology in the palm of their hands, and you can google just about anything, but you cannot google life experience. Okay? You can\\u2019t. You can\\u2019t download struggling. You can\\u2019t download failure. You can\\u2019t download these moments that help build you up to make you a better person. And so again, for me, I chose to stay in my lane and just crack jokes when the girl asked me the question. She got very upset. She got very offended. As soon as I cracked the joke, she was like, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not what I mean.\\u201d \\u201cI mean what are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cFor example, are you a they or them?\\u201d \\u201cA they\\u201d? [audience chuckles] \\u201cOr a them\\u201d? [audience laughs] \\u201cHow fat am I?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhen did I stop being an it?\\u201d Apparently, I ate myself into a plural. That\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience chuckles and applauds]\\nWhat I\\u2019m finding is, even if you have good intentions, and you\\u2019re trying to be cool, you can still find yourself in a situation. So, I\\u2019ll tell you what else happened to me, m\\u2019kay? I was at a McDonald\\u2019s. [audience chuckles] That\\u2019s not even the joke, but okay. [audience laughs] All righty. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHere, this is gonna be good.\\u201d No, no! I was at a McDonald\\u2019s by my house. The McDonald\\u2019s by my house is actually a twofer. It\\u2019s a McDonald\\u2019s on the corner, and it\\u2019s also a gas station. I got a big SUV. I knew it was gonna be a minute. So I said, \\u201cLet me go get some nuggets while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I walk into the McDonald\\u2019s, and as I\\u2019m walking in, I couldn\\u2019t help but notice this homeless family sitting right outside. Now, they didn\\u2019t have a sign. They did not ask me for money, but you could just tell. You could just tell that this poor family is dealing with life. So I get inside, and I said, \\u201cYou know what?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t need anything to eat.\\u201d \\u201cI really don\\u2019t. At this point, it\\u2019s just the habit.\\u201d [audience laughs] I get to the register, and I say, \\u201cYou know what? Let me order some food for the family.\\u201d \\u201cThey got kids with them.\\u201d So I placed an order and the cashier\\u2019s like, \\u201cAnything else?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes. Do you have, um\\u2026 um, Wet-Naps?\\u201d \\u201cExcuse me?\\u201d \\u201cYou know, Wet-Naps to clean your hands.\\u201d \\u201cSir, you\\u2019re more than welcome to use the restroom.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll give you the code.\\u201d \\u201cHere\\u2019s the thing.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s not for me. It\\u2019s for the homeless family that\\u2019s right outside the door.\\u201d \\u201cI want to make sure that the little kids can clean their hands before they eat.\\u201d \\u201cThis food that I just ordered is for them.\\u201d And as we\\u2019re talking\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you. As we\\u2019re talking, the manager at the McDonald\\u2019s is listening in to our conversation. And she walks over. And she\\u2019s all nosy, right? She\\u2019s like, \\u201cExcuse me. I couldn\\u2019t help but overhear.\\u201d \\u201cDid you just say that this food is for the family outside?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I hope that\\u2019s okay.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, it is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cGiving food to people who need food is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cHowever, what you just called them is not okay.\\u201d [audience groans] [as self] \\u201cWhat did I call them?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cYou said\\u2026 homeless.\\u201d [as self] \\u201c\\u2018Cause they are! Look. Shit.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cHe\\u2019s lickin\\u2019 the window!\\u201d [audience laughs] [as manager] \\u201cYou can\\u2019t say that word. It\\u2019s considered offensive.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWho complained?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, well, if I\\u2019m not supposed to say the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019 anymore, what am I supposed to say instead of the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cThe new politically correct term is actually \\u2018unhoused\\u2019 when describing someone in an unfortunate situation like that.\\u201d [audience jeering] [as self] \\u201cYou\\u2019re kidding.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, sir. I\\u2019m not kidding. And please lower your voice.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYou want me to lower my voice when you\\u2019re saying something so ridiculous?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cIf you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly, you are part of the problem, not the solution.\\u201d [audience chuckling] Oh, Miami. I wanted to get ghetto. [audience cheers] I wanted to get ghetto. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I wanted to go full Hialeah on them. [audience cheering] [man] Love you, Fluffy! Thank you for coming, Hialeah. [audience cheers] So yeah, I wanted to go off on her, but I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I wanted to get ghetto, but I couldn\\u2019t because that is the regular McDonald\\u2019s I go to.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nYou know what I\\u2019m saying? I\\u2019m not trying to get banned. The next one\\u2019s far, and gas is a bitch, so I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNah.\\u201d So I looked at her, and I said, \\u201cOkay. We\\u2019re gonna play this game?\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s play this game.\\u201d \\u201cFrom now on, I\\u2019m no longer fat.\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201cAccording to you, I am now \\u2018unexercised.'\\u201d [audience laughs] [audience cheering] I did, bro. She looked at me, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t be ridiculous.\\u201d And I looked at her, and I was like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d \\u201cOh, well, if you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly you are part of the problem.\\u201d \\u201cNot the solution.\\u201d [audience cheers] And I grabbed the food, and I walked out. Now, second half of the story. I walk over to the family. M\\u2019kay? And I hand the bags of food to the mom. And the mom was so nice. She was just happy that someone thought of her and her kids. She got very emotional. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI just want to say thank you.\\u201d \\u201cYou have no idea what you\\u2019re doing for us right now.\\u201d \\u201cThis really means a lot.\\u201d \\u201cThank you.\\u201d And I had to ask the question. [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I know what you thought. Some of you are like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it.\\u201d Oh, I did it. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. Watch. So, I looked, and I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d And she was like, \\u201cNo, unfortunately. We\\u2019re not okay. We\\u2019re not.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been homeless now for four days.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you heard.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cBut, uh\\u2026\\u201d No, not\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience chuckles] I didn\\u2019t correct her \\u2019cause I\\u2019m not a dick. That\\u2019s why I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience laughs] That\\u2019s what I mean, you guys. Even if you have good intentions nowadays, people can take what you\\u2019re saying or doing and twist it to make you look bad. There should be no consequences for being kind, for trying to help, for wanting to do the right thing, for caring. Unfortunately, we\\u2019re still consumed by this word called \\u201cliability\\u201d that sometimes we forget to be a little human, and that\\u2019s unfortunate. I\\u2019m not trying to get on a soapbox about this. I\\u2019m trying to let you know some things I\\u2019ve been dealing with, and I\\u2019m just here to report. [audience chuckles] The thing with me now is that after 27 years of being a comedian, every time I walk out the door, the light is officially on. In the sense that every time I leave my house, there is a slight chance I could make the news. For example, did Martin talk about how, uh, he fell off the stage earlier in the show?\\n[crowd] Yeah.\\nOkay. Okay, cool. Uh, for the home audience, Martin, he fell a while back. He talked about it. I know you didn\\u2019t see it, \\u2019cause your subscription only covers so much.\\nUm, yeah.\\n[audience laughs] You can watch the first half on Prime. I think it\\u2019s on Prime. Maybe you can just see it there then come back and check out the rest. So, long story short, we were doing a show in Phoenix, Arizona, and Martin accidentally fell off of a stage this high, and he broke his foot. Now, the incredible part about Martin is that he got up, and on adrenaline, ran around, got back up on stage, and performed. And then was taken to the hospital after he walked off stage. He is a professional. [audience cheers] Seriously, that is a pro. Much respect \\u2019cause if it would have been me\\u2026 [audience chuckles] If I would\\u2019ve fallen off stage, and the staff was like, \\u201cWhat about the fans?\\u201d \\u201cWell, bye, Felicia.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhat do we tell \\u2019em?\\u201d \\u201cRefund.\\u201d [audience laughs] But see, the difference is Martin had to tell you he fell for you to know he fell. And by the way, I saw the fall. I saw. He came out and just kind of tripped over a cord backstage, came through the curtain already, you know. And then, you know\\u2026 \\u201cMartiiin!\\u201d [imitates thud] Women in the front row were like, \\u201cHe fell for me.\\u201d [audience laughs] I\\u2019m glad you laughed. I said that last night and some guy was like, \\u201cAw.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cWhy \\u2018aww\\u2019?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s your friend.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cExactly. That\\u2019s why I make fun of him.\\u201d That is the mark of a true friendship, is being able to say real evil things about each other. [audience cheers] Because you know you don\\u2019t really mean it. Plus, you don\\u2019t think that if I would\\u2019ve fallen off the stage instead of Martin that he wouldn\\u2019t\\u2019ve had a joke? You better believe he would have had a joke. He would have told people, \\u201cI saw Fluffy bounce.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot to mention the fact that you know that\\u2019ll make the news. I fall off the stage tonight, there\\u2019ll be a van out in front in an hour. \\u201cWe\\u2019re standing here live in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, where authorities believe Fluffy lost control.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to Tom, who\\u2019s inside the venue who can fill us in with more.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, Jim, I\\u2019m standing here at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, inside the venue where apparently Fluffy took a spill.\\u201d \\u201cIt is still uncertain as to what happened here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cWe did have a chance to interview local authorities who had this to say.\\u201d \\u201cDamn!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt is still uncertain if there was any problems with the stage.\\u201d \\u201cWe did speak to security who had this to comment.\\u201d \\u201cI saw the whole damn thing. Okay?\\u201d \\u201cWhoo! Fluffy fell. He fell hard.\\u201d \\u201cI ain\\u2019t seen that many white people cry since a Taylor Swift concert.\\u201d \\u201cIt was bad. It was bad. And in Miami. Are you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cHe hurt more Cubans than Castro.\\u201d [audience laughs] And that\\u2019s how you get canceled. So, uh, that\\u2019s the point I\\u2019m trying to make here. I made the news recently. Uh, without giving too much away, there\\u2019s an episode of Family Feud coming out very soon that I\\u2019m gonna be on. Yeah.\\n[audience applauds]\\nIt is the celebrity edition, so it\\u2019s Fluffy and Fluffy\\u2019s family versus Fat Joe\\u2026 [audience gasps] \\u2026and his family. So yeah, it\\u2019s Fat Joe versus Fluffy because apparently, the producers have a great sense of humor. [audience laughs] Long story short, I flew in some family from the East Coast to be on the show. The show went over very well. You\\u2019ll find out who wins later. Here\\u2019s the deal. The next day, my sister, who was one of the people I flew in, she hadn\\u2019t been in California in forever, and she was like, \\u201cCan we go to Disneyland?\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cSure, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d So it was her and her husband Gordy, and I took them to Disney. And we get on a couple of rides, and just so we\\u2019re clear, that\\u2019s not what made the news. [audience chuckles] I said that last night, someone was like, \\u201c\\u2018Cause he fit.\\u201d No!\\n[audience laughs]\\nSome people. Right? Yeah. We get on the Cars ride at California Adventure, and halfway through the Cars ride, the car\\u2026 [imitates engine revving, brakes screeching] \\u2026stops on the track. And my sister looked at me. She goes, \\u201cIs this supposed to happen?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, the check cleared. We\\u2019re supposed to finish. This is, uh\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWe paid. It\\u2019s supposed to work. No, this\\u2026\\u201d It took the Disney people about 20 minutes to come get us and take us out of the car. So we\\u2019re sitting there, outside, in the sun for 20 minutes. I had no problem with that because I am mocha. I\\u2019m okay in the sun for 20 minutes. My sister, she\\u2019s twice as dark as me. She\\u2019s, like, freaking, you know, Apache. She\\u2019s\\u2026 You know. Freaking Azteca. [chanting] Just, you know\\u2026 Her husband, on the other hand, he\\u2019s from Minnesota. [audience laughs] He almost died.\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cOh, don\\u2019 cha know?\\u201d Yeah, so\\u2026 while we\\u2019re sitting there in the car, waiting for the Disney people to come take us out of the car, the people waiting in line realize that the ride has been shut down. And so from the ride, you can see the line. People see the car on the track, and then they see who\\u2019s in the car. [audience chuckles] And all of a sudden, cell phones start comin\\u2019 out. And by the time we left Disney, TMZ had already reported the story, and you can google this, okay? TMZ reported the story. Before we left the park, it said, \\u201cFluffy Stuck on LA Freeway at Disney.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I thought it was cute. I thought it was silly. I thought it was funny. I thought it was okay. Until I read the comments. [audience chuckles] Oh, some of you\\u2026 are dicks. [audience laughs] One lady wrote, \\u201cJust \\u2019cause you\\u2019re tall enough to ride doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re small enough to fit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nA guy wrote, \\u201cThe car got tired.\\u201d [audience laughs] Another guy wrote, \\u201cYou\\u2019re Mexican. Couldn\\u2019t you fix it?\\u201d [audience laughs] And that was Martin, yeah. So\\u2026 [audience laughs] [imitates rim shot] Anyway, so\\u2026 The time before that, we made world news. Some of you might remember this story. The guys and I were involved in an emergency landing situation. I had, uh, chartered a private jet because my last Netflix special, the money finally hit my account, and I, you know, freakin\\u2019\\u2026 I thought I was, y\\u2019know, ballin\\u2019, right? Nope. Turns out we were fallin\\u2019! Worst turbulence we have ever experienced in 27 years of being comedians. Uh, worst turbulence I ever felt, for sure. At one point, the jet did this.\\n[whooshes]\\n[audience chuckles] I did this.\\n[imitates thud]\\n[audience chuckles] The scariest part was watching my dogs leave the seat. Fortunately, we landed safely. We were okay. That\\u2019s not what made the news. What made the news is that, when we came in for the landing, the jet touched down, and then it skid off the runway by 200 yards, and we ended up in a field. A field. A field! Are you kidding me? As hard as I work\\u2026 [audience laughs] [audience applauds] \\u2026to break stereotypes. [audience laughs] A bunch of Mexicans ended up in a field. Yeah, that\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat\\u2019s how TMZ reported it. \\u201cMexicans Found in Field.\\u201d [audience chuckles] In the movies, the pilots are always the first to know when there\\u2019s an issue. And in the movies, the pilots always have the courtesy of telling the passengers. They love to hear themselves talk. They get on the mic, \\u201cAll right. It\\u2019s your captain speaking here.\\u201d \\u201cI just want to let you know we\\u2019ll be experiencing rough air.\\u201d \\u201cIf you could just fasten your seatbelts, we\\u2019re gonna be A-okay. All right\\u2026\\u201d [murmurs] You know? If it gets bumpy, you know, [whooshing] [as captain, mumbling] \\u201cIt\\u2019s your captain speaking.\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just had a little Mexican food here, so we\\u2026 we\\u2019re feeling a little bumpy up here.\\u201d \\u201cWe just had some fast food.\\u201d \\u201cJust a reminder to keep your seat belts fastened.\\u201d \\u201cWe might be getting a bit\\u2026 There we go. Just a bit there.\\u201d [laughs] \\u201cAll right, I\\u2019ll be back with you in just a few seconds\\u2026\\u201d [mumbles indistinctly] If the plane\\u2019s going down, \\u201cBrace for impact!\\u201d \\u201cHold on tight! We\\u2019re comin\\u2019 in hot!\\u201d Our pilot\\u2026 nada.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOur pilot didn\\u2019t say anything until we came to, like, a complete stop. And then maybe like a minute later, the cockpit door opened up, and he stuck his head in, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou good?\\u201d [audience laughs] I was like, \\u201cMy chihuahua\\u2019s in a cup holder. I am not good.\\u201d It was a scary situation, you guys, but let me tell you, even though we were involved in an emergency landing and we thought we were gonna die, I\\u2019m grateful for the experience. Believe it or not. I\\u2019m grateful because it reminded me how valuable life is and how quickly things can change.\\n[audience applauds]\\nEvery now and then, we need a little reminder. We need to get shaken up a little to remind ourselves, \\u201cOh my God. This is special.\\u201d \\u201cThis is important. Enjoy it. Have fun.\\u201d The rest of the day after the landing, there was nothing anybody could tell me to ruin how good I felt to just be breathing and be alive. Nothing! [audience cheers and applauds] And so, that\\u2019s why I, uh\\u2026 I\\u2019m grateful for bad moments. And I think bad moments are actually a good thing because we need balance in life. You need to have bad experiences in order to truly appreciate good experiences. Not every day can be the same. [audience applauds] You need to have a way to ba\\u2013 Now, don\\u2019t get me wrong. Sometimes there\\u2019s too many bad days in a row. That shit sucks. And that\\u2019s actually what happened to me. After the near-death experience, I go home. I go home to find out that someone broke into my house. [audience gasps] Yeah. Yeah, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I survived? To see this shit?\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why you haven\\u2019t heard about it until now is because the detective who\\u2019s working the case told me I\\u2019m not allowed to talk about it. In California.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah, if the guys that broke into my house are here tonight\\u2026 [scoffs] \\u2026bravo. [sarcastically] Bravo. That\\u2019s a flex and a half. No, they broke into my house, and of course, the number one question is, \\u201cWhat did they take from your house?\\u201d And what they took from me, honestly, it was my peace of mind. I didn\\u2019t feel safe in that house after. Uh, but if you must know, I did everything to prevent a break-in. I had, first of all, a good neighborhood. I had an alarm. I had two camera systems. I had a fence that surrounded the property. I thought I was good. Um, I got video footage of the entire robbery.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIn 4K. [audience chuckles] Oh, that shit is crisp. I saw the guys that broke in, but I could not identify them because they were wearing masks. All I can tell you about the two guys that broke into my house is that they were 20 years old. I know they were 20 because when they jumped the fence and hit the ground, no pain.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf that would\\u2019ve been a 35-year-old with messed-up sciatica, he\\u2019d have thought twice about that fence. So, they jumped the fence, went in the backyard, and they broke the window and got in through the kitchen. They trashed my house. Okay, every drawer, open. Every cabinet, open. Everything got pulled out onto the floor so they could sift. Uh\\u2026 Couches were flipped over, cushions were thrown down, and they pulled every single frame off the wall. And I asked the detective, I said, \\u201cHey, look. I understand the drawers, the cabinets, and even the couch thing.\\u201d \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the story with the frames on the wall?\\u201d \\u201cWhy did they take everything off the wall but didn\\u2019t take any frames?\\u201d \\u201cSome of that stuff was art.\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cMr. Iglesias, you have to understand something about these people that broke into your home.\\u201d \\u201cThey were not looking for photos or art.\\u201d \\u201cThey were actually looking for a safe.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cYes, sir. A safe.\\u201d \\u201cA lot of times, in these homes, people will put a hole in the wall, install a safe, and then they\\u2019ll hang a frame over the safe to disguise that their valuables are in there.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d\\n[audience chuckles]\\n[as cop] \\u201cSir, yes, a safe.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cBut I just got this money.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cDid they check the mattress?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as cop] \\u201cDon\\u2019t know.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s find out!\\u201d So, we walk into the master bedroom. I grab the edge of the bed, right? And I picked it up, and I was like, \\u201cAh, stupid!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all here.\\u201d Oh my God. These guys had no idea they were robbing somebody more ghetto than them. [audience laughs] So, at the end of it, they only got a couple of little trinkets from the drawers. Um, and that\\u2019s pretty much it. They made a mess of the house. They didn\\u2019t get any of the money. I\\u2019ll tell you what they did get. They got my guns. [audience exclaims] Now\\u2026 I have never been open about the fact that I am, in fact, a registered gun owner.\\n[audience cheers]\\nRelax, Florida. [audience laughs] I\\u2019ve never been open about it because, quite frankly, it\\u2019s nobody\\u2019s business. Okay? However, it does pertain to the story that I\\u2019m about to share with you. Um, I am a recent gun owner. I became a gun owner in 2020, m\\u2019kay? Uh, yeah, when we were in the middle of\\u2026 [loudly] \\u2026it. [audience laughs] Every morning watching the news, we didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen, and it started to feel irresponsible, not preparing myself for a worst-case situation. Every morning watching the news, it felt like we were headed towards the Purge. [audience chuckles] Some of you are laughing, but think about this, the Purge would have taken less time. [audience chuckles] Yeah, the Purge. That\\u2019s how they should\\u2019ve woke us up, at least for entertainment purposes. [imitates alarm sounding] [feminine voice] \\u201cI\\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in the pandemic.\\u201d \\u201cThe local time is 7:45 a.m.\\u201d [moans seductively]\\n[audience laughs]\\nFear is why I decided to buy a gun. I was afraid, and I got no problem saying that. I was scared. We didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen. Um, it\\u2019s only for protection. I don\\u2019t hunt. I don\\u2019t want to hunt. I don\\u2019t need to. I know where there\\u2019s three Chick-fil-As. [audience laughs] I\\u2019m good. I don\\u2019t go out on the weekends, you know? Pull! [imitates rifle firing] There\\u2019s no\\u2026 [quacking] I still own a Nintendo. I don\\u2019t need that shit. Fear is the only reason why I decided to buy a gun. So, I wound up at this sporting goods store right by my house. I walk in there, and this place is packed full of people that normally would not have been open to the idea of owning a gun, but they felt like me. They were scared, and rightfully so. I kept hearing the same conversation over and over and over. I kept hearing this\\u2026 \\u201cI would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it.\\u201d [audience cheers] [audience applauds] And I don\\u2019t care where you\\u2019re from, that makes a lot of sense. And I was not about to let politics interfere with my personal safety. So, next thing you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] So, next thing you know, I got in line. I had to get a ticket with a number like when you\\u2019re at the DMV or meat market. [in Spanish] The butcher shop. The bodega. \\u201cNumber five!\\u201d [in English] I got in line. Forty-five minutes, I waited in line. And as soon as I get to the front, this guy comes to the counter, and he\\u2019s like\\u2026 [in Southern accent] \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, um\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I heard some of you chuckle, and just so we\\u2019re clear, I\\u2019m not saying that\\u2026 all people [sighs] \\u2026who sell guns\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u2026talk like that. [audience laughs] But his name was Jim. [audience laughs] So, Jim was like, \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m here to see about purchasing my first firearm.\\u201d \\u201cWell, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Know what you want?\\u201d \\u201cOr you need a hand?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019ve had some time to look at your selection, and I think I found something that\\u2019s gonna work for me.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. Show me what you got.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, right over here in the case.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, right here.\\u201d \\u201cThis one. The one right here, in the front.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. Not that one. This one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. This one. Not that one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. The one in front.\\u201d \\u201cWith the tag. The tag. Right here. The one that says two-two.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cUm, sir, did you just call that gun\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cYeah. What?\\u201d \\u201cJi\\u2026 Jim, right? Jim? Jim.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at me like I\\u2019m crazy, dude. I\\u2019m just reading the tag.\\u201d \\u201cIt says it right here. In the front. It says two-two.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou mean a .22?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, yeah. I guess. Two-two, .22, same thing.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, I hate to break it to you, but there\\u2019s a big difference between a tutu and a .22.\\u201d \\u201cBut hey, this is California, so whatever floats your boat, son.\\u201d \\u201cAll right?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cNow, is there any particular reason why you have selected a, uh\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cWell, um, as impressive as your selection of guns here is, I recognize a lot of them from movies.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s a bit much for me.\\u201d \\u201cUm, I\\u2019m very simple.\\u201d \\u201cUm, this gun looks very manageable.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s small and, you know, it looks easy.\\u201d \\u201cPlus, it\\u2019s on sale.\\u201d \\u201cYou know what I mean? Come on, man. A gun\\u2019s a gun, right?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as Jim] \\u201cNot exactly.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIs this not a good choice?\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, you want my opinion, or you want to buy and be done with it?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNo, please tell me if I\\u2019m making a mistake.\\u201d \\u201cIs\\u2026 is a\\u2026 a .22 a good gun or a bad gun?\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, in my personal opinion, you\\u2019re better off tickling him, as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cAll you\\u2019re gonna do is aggravate the situation.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re just gonna piss him off is what I\\u2019m trying to tell you.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, listen to my thought process.\\u201d \\u201cMy whole idea for the gun is, I\\u2019m gonna use the gun more so like as a deterrent.\\u201d \\u201cSo if somebody breaks into the house, they\\u2019re gonna see this big bald Mexican holding a gun, and then they\\u2019re gonna think twice and then rob my neighbors instead.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, if somebody breaks into your house and they have a gun, they\\u2019re gonna know you\\u2019re holding a .22.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s gon\\u2019 happen. They\\u2019re gon\\u2019 take it from ya.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cAnd they\\u2019re gonna beat the holy hell outta you with it. Right?\\u201d \\u201cAnd the beating you\\u2019re gon\\u2019 get from a .22 is gonna hurt a hell of a lot more than the bullets out of a .22.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s for damn sure.\\u201d [audience applauds] \\u201cNow, listen, I don\\u2019t know you, but I think I know your situation.\\u201d \\u201cAnd correct me if I\\u2019m wrong.\\u201d \\u201cYou want to protect your home?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYour family?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYour valuables?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right, follow me.\\u201d \\u201cI think I got just what you need right here.\\u201d \\u201cM\\u2019kay?\\u201d \\u201cYou see this right here? This here\\u2019s a 9 millimeter to start.\\u201d\\n[crowd cheers]\\n\\u201cOkay?\\u201d \\u201cA 9 millimeter is a solid firearm.\\u201d \\u201cTwo to the chest, that man is going down, ten out of ten.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cHowever, I got this special military-grade ammunition over here.\\u201d \\u201cI got this here bullet.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s called a spreader.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s what I used to call my ex.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cShe was a real pistol too, let me tell you.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I had to move to California. She\\u2019ll never find me here.\\u201d \\u201cSo, this bullet, when it comes out the chamber, it opens up.\\u201d \\u201cAnd when it hits, it\\u2019ll leave a hole about yay big.\\u201d And stupid me, I said this, I said, \\u201cPeople survive that?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as Jim] \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSon, you don\\u2019t want \\u2019em to survive.\\u201d \\u201cYou want \\u2019em dead as fried chicken, as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\u201d [audience applauds] I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anybody to die.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want anybody to die?!\\u201d \\u201cYou guys hear that?\\u201d \\u201cYou hear that?

I felt that. I felt it.\\u201d Um\\u2026 \\u201cIf I\\u2019m cornered like that, and I have absolutely no choice, and my life is in danger, I promise you, Jim, I will step up, man, and I will shoot them right in the leg.\\u201d \\u201cI will.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cYou think you\\u2019re gonna hit the leg, Mr. First-Time Gun Owner?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHey, if I buy that bullet you\\u2019re trying to sell me, that covers that much, up close, I can hit a leg.\\u201d \\u201cTwo steps closer, I\\u2019ll shoot him in the huevos. I will, dude.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll hit a pelota. I will. No more babies, man.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. All right. You don\\u2019t gotta get graphic on me, now.\\u201d \\u201cSon, you know what\\u2019s gonna happen if you shoot someone in your home, in the leg, and they live?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I know.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sleep better, knowing I didn\\u2019t take a life and I was able to protect my home, my family, and my stuff.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen.\\u201d [as Jim] Ah. \\u201cClearly, you\\u2019re a Disney fan.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cThat\\u2019s about the biggest fantasy I\\u2019ve ever heard, right there.\\u201d \\u201cSon, I would ask you if you knew, but clearly, you don\\u2019t, so I\\u2019m not gonna waste my time spinnin\\u2019 my wheels on this one.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna call it like it is.\\u201d \\u201cIf you shoot someone in your home and they live, they can come back and sue your ass.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. Now, here\\u2019s the kicker.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. They\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cAnd not only are they gonna get everything they wanted to get when they first broke in, when it\\u2019s all said and done, you are gonna cut them a big fat check.\\u201d \\u201cNow, what do you got to say about that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat motherfucker\\u2019s gonna die!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nHe got excited. [as Jim] \\u201cNow, we\\u2019re talkin\\u2019!\\u201d I found out something that day. I found out that people that sell guns are a lot like people that sell used cars. They play on your emotions, and then they start to upsell you and make you buy things you don\\u2019t want or need. He knew I was scared because he kept saying it to me. [as Jim] \\u201cI know you\\u2019re scared.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re scared, and your fears. You\\u2019re worried. You\\u2019re scared.\\u201d Every time he\\u2019d say \\u201cscared,\\u201d something else appeared on the counter. [audience laughs] He sold me so well that when he was done \\u201cselling me,\\u201d I wound up with four rifles\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026and four handguns and a case\\u2026 a case of spreader ammunition. [audience chuckles] I hear some of you clapping, and why? It\\u2019s excessive. I only have two hands. [audience laughs] See, I feel, again, even though my home was burglarized, I feel grateful because I wasn\\u2019t there and I had my dogs with me. I can\\u2019t replace my dogs. I can\\u2019t replace me. [audience cheering] Stuff is stuff. However, if I would have been home, I would have done whatever I needed to do. That\\u2019s the difference. In this situation, there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me, had the guns, had the ammo, glad they weren\\u2019t there, but if they were there, they would\\u2019ve done something about it. \\u2018Cause if I was in bed and I heard the\\u2026 [imitates crashing] \\u2026I would\\u2019ve jumped up. [grunting] I would\\u2019ve grabbed my gun. [imitates gun cocking] I would\\u2019ve ran out into the living room with no shirt on and one sock off.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI\\u2019d have confronted the person. \\u201cFreeze!\\u201d Knowing my luck\\u2026 [audience chuckles] [as burglar] \\u201cFluffy?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI said, freeze!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re funny. You\\u2019re funny, bro.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re funny.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cGet on the ground!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh!\\u201d [as self] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make me shoot you.\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cAh, hey!\\u201d [exclaims] \\u201cHey, Beto, get in here! Get in here! You\\u2019ll never guess whose house this is!\\u201d The other guy runs in. [as Beto] \\u201cOh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey.\\u201d \\u201cI grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience laughs and cheers] Next thing you know, I\\u2019m autographing things they\\u2019re about to take. [audience chuckles] [mouthing inaudibly] [audience laughs] [continues mouthing] [audience laughs] So like I said, in this situation, I feel like there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me. Had the guns, had the ammunition. Glad they weren\\u2019t home, but if they would have been home, they would have done something about it. That\\u2019s one type of people. The other kind of people are the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to\\u2026\\n[scattered cheering]\\nOh. Good. You\\u2019re here. [audience laughs] The kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to confront an intruder because you know you have way more guns and ammunition than they do, and you are prepared for war. [audience cheers] The kind of people who sit home at night in the living room, in the dark, holding their gun.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[imitates rifle cocking] They leave the front door unlocked to make it easier. [audience laughs] And people like that always have a friend either across the street or across town. \\u201cHow is everything over there on your side?\\u201d [imitating radio static] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all clear over here. How about you?\\u201d \\u201cYeah. Coast is clear. Ten-four. Out.\\u201d There. This situation, the break-in, left me traumatized. I couldn\\u2019t go back to living in the house because I didn\\u2019t feel safe. It\\u2019s just me and two chihuahuas. Yeah, that\\u2019s it. I\\u2019m no longer with my son\\u2019s mom, and my son lives with his mom. So, you know\\u2026 And by the way, I told my son Frankie what happened, about the break-in, and right away, right away, \\u201cOh, really? They\\u2019re lucky I wasn\\u2019t there.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cC\\u00e1lmate, John Wick.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThey would\\u2019ve kidnapped you.\\u201d \\u201cI would\\u2019ve had to pay double to get you back.\\u201d I could not go back to living at the house. Again, it\\u2019s just me. So, I put the house up for sale. Uh, yeah, I just couldn\\u2019t. And it was a big beautiful home that you guys helped pay for. Thank you. [audience chuckles] It was nice. Real nice. Freaking four bathrooms. Four bathrooms. Yeah. One penis.\\n[audience laughs]\\nEven if I ran, I couldn\\u2019t, you know\\u2026 I put the house up for sale, and here\\u2019s the dilemma that I faced. I put it up for sale before I had a new place to live because I figured I\\u2019m on the road, I\\u2019m always in a tour bus, a plane, a hotel, always somewhere. I\\u2019m on the go. I was just trying to get ahead of it because when I first bought the house, it was sitting on the market for almost two years. So I thought I had time. What happened was it sold like that because I had two people bidding on the house at the same time and they kept driving up the price. And one of the people trying to buy the house, he wanted all of my furniture and so my agent for the house goes, \\u201cGabriel, this is crazy.\\u201d \\u201cThese two guys are bidding on your house, and they want to give you way more than what you\\u2019re asking.\\u201d \\u201cOne of them wants to give you an extra $100,000 for all of your furniture.\\u201d \\u201cI suggest you take it.\\u201d And so, I did. I sold the house with everything, except the mattress. Everything. The problem is I don\\u2019t have a house right now. I don\\u2019t have anywhere to live, so technically, I\\u2019m, um\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\nFuck it. I\\u2019m homeless. I don\\u2019t care. [audience cheers] I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019m not gonna be \\u201cunhoused.\\u201d I\\u2019m homeless right now. They can\\u2019t cancel me. What are they gonna do? Take my house? I don\\u2019t have one. Ha! [audience laughs] So whatever. Mm. But no, at this point, at\\u2026 at 47 years of age, I don\\u2019t need more stuff. I\\u2019m happy that I do have stuff, but I don\\u2019t need it. What I want more than anything else now is better relationships. Better friendships, better people in my life, that\\u2019s what I want more than anything else. I announced in my last special at Dodger Stadium that I was no longer in a relationship. And I thought that was the best place to announce that because I\\u2019ve been very open about my life, my whole show is my life. People kept asking about her. So I thought that was the best place to announce that. You know what happens when you tell 50,000 people at a stadium that you\\u2019re single and then Netflix airs that around the world? I received thousands of \\u201capplications\\u201d for the Fluffy fulfillment center. Yes, I did. [chime dings] [Gabriel] That\\u2019s right, Netflix. Fluffy is hoein\\u2019 out. [audience chuckles] It was incredible. It was exciting. It was overwhelming, And it was terrifying because I didn\\u2019t know what they wanted. Um, well, I\\u2019m gonna tell you that since announcing that I was single, I\\u2019ve gone out on a few dates. And, uh, yeah. I don\\u2019t want to say how many, \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t want your judgment. [chuckles] \\u201cFluffy\\u2019s a whore.\\u201d [in English and Spanish] \\u201cHe\\u2019s nasty.\\u201d [in English] \\u201cHe\\u2019s like Santa with all his ho ho hos, yeah.\\u201d I still want to go out. I still want to have fun, I want to make connections, but unfortunately, I don\\u2019t trust people. I\\u2019m afraid. I can meet people really easy, but then I find out what they\\u2019re up to, and that sucks. Um, my heart is guarded now. Super guarded. There\\u2019s a wall and then a wall and then a wall and a wall and a wall. I\\u2019m like the only Mexican who likes walls.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo moving forward, I can tell you I don\\u2019t want to be in another relationship. I\\u2019m actually doing okay. I still want to go out, but I don\\u2019t want to be in a committed relationship. I\\u2026 I don\\u2019t. No.\\n[man boos]\\n[grunts] What do you mean, \\u201cBoo\\u201d? The fact that I\\u2019m being honest about that I don\\u2019t want to be in a relationship, I think there\\u2019s something to be said about that. I could easily lie. Meet someone, say that we\\u2019re boyfriend/girlfriend, and have a thing. But does it mean anything if your behavior doesn\\u2019t change? I\\u2019m being up front and honest. All I want\\u2026 All I want\\u2026 All I want, watch\\u2026 To the guy that booed me for saying I don\\u2019t want a relationship. Raise your hand so I can\\u2026 Okay, you\\u2019re famous, so\\u2026\\nTo you\\u2026 What is your name?\\n[man] Justin.\\nJustin?\\nDustin. Dustin. All right, Dustin. Sorry for\\u2026 \\u201cDustin!\\u201d Like, all right, \\u201cChill, bitch.\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, right? Freakin\\u2019 \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [Gabriel and audience laugh] All right, Dustin. Me not wanting to be in a traditional relationship is a honest thing because, uh, I can tell you, I don\\u2019t want to be in a situation where I\\u2019m obligated to participate in things that don\\u2019t make me feel like a good person. And at the age of 47, I\\u2019m tired of arguing, yelling, feeling guilted, feeling obligated, not smiling more. [audience cheers] I\\u2019m good, man. I\\u2026 You know\\u2026 But I still want to go out. So I just want to be up front and honest. All I need, Dustin, watch, is someone to eat with. [audience cheers] Someone to drink with. Someone to go to movies with. And someone to cuddle with. [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And they don\\u2019t even gotta be the same person.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll I\\u2019m saying is sometimes it takes a village. Okay? Dustin, I would love to tell a woman, \\u201cHey, would you like to go see a movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cYeah.\\u201d Then we go. After the movie\\u2019s over, I go, \\u201cWhat did you think?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cRight?\\u201d \\u201cWould you like to see another movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cSure. When?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNext week?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s stay in touch. See you next week.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna be so cool. You like rom-coms. I like rom-coms.\\u201d \\u201cYou like horror movies. I like horror.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna work. I like this. I need this. [grunts] Can\\u2019t wait.\\u201d So I say, \\u201cAll right, gotta go.\\u201d And she gets weird. [as woman] \\u201cWait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.\\u201d \\u201cYou gotta go? I thought this was going good.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s going great. We\\u2019ll do more next week. This is cool.\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the rush?\\u201d \\u201cWhere are you headed? Where you going?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cUh, I\\u2019m about to call the cuddler. Why?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as woman] \\u201cThe cuddler, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI got that covered.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, movies, that\\u2019s your lane. Stay in it, okay?\\u201d \\u201cThis is us. We\\u2019re good. Solid. You\\u2019re the movie girl, okay?\\u201d Now, Dustin. I didn\\u2019t tell her. But I\\u2019m gonna tell you. When it comes to the department of cuddling, and this is so crazy because I\\u2019ve always been in a relationship and I could never be this open and honest, but now that I\\u2019m single, these are Fluffy\\u2019s flavors. [audience laughs] So, when it comes to the department of cuddling, this is what I want. I want a woman. A woman. A woman. With original factory settings. [audience laughs and cheers] [speaks indistinctly] This woman needs to be equal to, or greater than, in size. She needs to be a big girl. I prefer a big girl.\\nI want a big girl.\\n[audience cheers] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. This way, we both can agree on the temperature of the thermostat. [audience laughs and applauds] And only big girls know what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. [audience laughs] See, I\\u2019m a big boy, and as a big boy, I always run hot. Heat affects my mood. When I\\u2019m hot, Dustin, I become irritable, cranky, my anxiety goes through the roof. So for me to feel comfortable, I like to set the room to 68 degrees. Okay? [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And only a big girl can truly appreciate that. Skinny women, not so much. And let me tell you, I am tired of disappointing, skinny, cold women. [audience laughs] Skinny, cold women are mean. They\\u2019re mean. They don\\u2019t want it at freakin\\u2019 68 degrees. No, they want 72, 73, 74. [in Spanish] You\\u2019re killing me. No! [in English] But I can\\u2019t do that to them. I can\\u2019t put them in 68 degrees. They get snippy. They get evil. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh my God. What\\u2019s your problem?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cWell, fuckin\\u2019 eat something.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] \\u201cI\\u2019m tired of sweating.\\u201d But, yeah. Anyway, Dustin, I apologize. I wasn\\u2019t trying to turn this into a TED Talk. [audience chuckles] I don\\u2019t want you to think that I don\\u2019t believe in love because I do, and anyone who can pull it off, I commend you for it. I have met so many couples over the years. I\\u2019ve met 20-year couples, 30-year couples, 40-year couples, 50-year couples. I met one 55.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. Yeah. I call them unicorns. I\\u2019ll tell you the story. I was in Savannah, Georgia. And I had just finished filming the second Magic Mike movie. Now\\u2026 Yeah, I know. For those of you that don\\u2019t know, I was in Magic Mike. [audience cheers] Yes. I know. I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. [audience laughs] Magic Mike, not Tragic Mike. So, let\\u2019s remember that, okay? I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. So, um\\u2026 Here\\u2019s the thing, after the movie, after we wrapped, my manager, Joe, tells me, he says, \\u201cDude, man.\\u201d \\u201cCongratulations on another project.\\u201d \\u201cI want to take you out for a steak dinner.\\u201d I said, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d So he takes me to this restaurant called Ruth\\u2019s Chris Steak House. Now, very popular chain around the country. We go there, we sit down, and here comes the server and the server\\u2019s real bubbly. \\u201cHey, guys. What\\u2019s going on? Are we celebrating anything today?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes, we are.\\u201d \\u201cWell, guess what? You\\u2019re not the only ones.\\u201d \\u201cYou see that couple over there?\\u201d \\u201cThat couple is celebrating 55 years of marriage today.\\u201d And we\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d So, we look. [whoosh]\\n[audience chuckles]\\nI said, \\u201cHow come they\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as server] \\u201cI wondered the same thing, but the man made it a point to say 55 years.\\u201d \\u201cI thought that was pretty impressive.\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, it is.\\u201d So he leaves to go get us some sodas and some bread. And I tell my manager, I said, \\u201cHey, Joe, listen.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019mma go say hi to the couple real quick.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t get us kicked out.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make it like last time.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s not gonna be.\\u201d So I get up, and I push in my chair, and I make my way over to the couple. Now, I understand how important this night is for them. I know exactly how long it took to get to that point, and I am not trying to mess that up. But I have questions. [audience chuckles] And these two people are clearly professionals in that department. So I approached the table as tactfully as I could. And I said, \\u201cPardon the interruption.\\u201d \\u201cIt has come to my attention that we are celebrating 55 years of marriage.\\u201d And the man was so happy that someone acknowledged that. He was just thrilled. He\\u2019s like\\u2026 [breathing excitedly] [as older man] \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, son.\\u201d \\u201cFifty-five years ago today, this lovely lady sittin\\u2019 next to me right here said I do, and we\\u2019ve been together ever since.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cThat is beautiful.\\u201d \\u201cMay I ask you a question?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cAbsolutely.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHow come you\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience chuckles] [laughs as older man] \\u201cHe wants to know how come we\\u2019re\\u2026 Laugh, goddammit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cSon, when you\\u2019ve been together as long as the two of us have, you might\\u2019ve seen a thing or two.\\u201d Uh, uh\\u2026 \\u201cWe have children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.\\u201d \\u201cWe have traveled this great big world of ours many times over.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re both retired military.\\u201d \\u201cWe have seen the best in people.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, unfortunately, when you\\u2019re around and alive as long as the two of us have been, uh, you\\u2019ve unfortunately seen the worst in people as well.\\u201d \\u201cWe have had just about every type of conversation there is to have. [audience chuckles] At least twice. [audience laughs] And after 55 years of marriage, well, hell, we\\u2019re just trying to enjoy each other\\u2019s company, even if it\\u2019s in silence.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve had every type of conversation there is to have?\\u201d And I guess I triggered him, because he was like, \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been in combat.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can faze me.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can surprise me anymore.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t say.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] So, I took a step towards them, I grab my shirt, and I flash them. [audience laughs] And then I walked away. And you know what happened next? They started talking! [audience laughs and cheers] I gave that couple the greatest gift they will never ever acknowledge. Something new, something spontaneous, something outrageous, something neither one of them had ever seen before. I gave them a new story. I promise you, every year moving forward, all they\\u2019re gonna talk about is what happened at 55. [as older man] \\u201cRemember, honey. Remember when that Samoan flashed us?\\u201d [audience laughs] Right. \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m a giver. I remember many, many years ago, before there was a venue like this to perform in, the only place around here for comedians to do shows was at a comedy club right outside these doors that was part of the original layout of the casino. [audience cheers] It was a club called The Improv. There\\u2019s a chain all over. [audience cheers] And, you know, many, many years ago, before all of this, that\\u2019s where Martin and myself, my buddy Alfred, we\\u2019d go do shows at the\\u2026 at the club. And the first time we got a chance to perform there, I didn\\u2019t really have a name. I wasn\\u2019t really established yet. And I want to take this moment to acknowledge and thank one person who was super, super helpful in that, a man by the name of DJ Laz.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s right, people. The Pimp with the Limp. Oh, yeah, Pap\\u00e1. Yeah. \\u201cIt\\u2019s your boy, DJ Laz.\\u201d I love him, man. He\\u2019s great. He\\u2019s awesome. But yeah, he walks in circles. He does. He walks in circles. Nice guy. DJ Laz was one of the first people to allow me to be on morning radio with him, and he helped promote my shows. Not only would he allow me to go on his show and promote my shows, he would come to my shows, and he would bring people, and he\\u2019d watch and he\\u2019d sit and hang out and laugh. The man has a million things he can do in Miami, but he\\u2019d come watch my show. And then the next day, \\u201cPap\\u00e1, come on the radio with me.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna talk about your show.\\u201d And he would help me sell out these shows year after year after year. So, Laz, I know you\\u2019re watching, Pap\\u00e1. Thank you. This is part of you, Pap\\u00e1. Muchas gracias. Thank you. Thank you. But that was many years down the line. In the beginning, the first time I performed at that comedy club, right outside these doors, that\\u2019s no longer there\\u2026 Um, I\\u2019m talking to the marketing person. Now, keep in mind, this is so long ago, there was no social media. There was no TikTok, no freaking Twitter, no Facebook, none of that. The only way you could promote yourself back then was, you had to get on morning radio, morning news, have somebody do a write-up on you in the newspaper. Remember those? Yeah. And then, of course, word-of-mouth, which is always the best. Uh, they had posters at the comedy club. And so, the marketing guy goes, \\u201cGabriel.\\u201d \\u201cHelp me help you help us.\\u201d \\u201cWe want to sell tickets. How do you want to be promoted?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWell\\u2026\\u201d Keep in mind, long time ago. I said, \\u201cUm, this is how I want you to promote my show.\\u201d \\u201cPlease use a photo.\\u201d \\u201cUnder the photo, put my name, Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t have the nickname Fluffy yet. That\\u2019s how long ago this was. I said, \\u201cUnderneath that, please put, \\u2018As seen on Comedy Central.'\\u201d Because at the time, that was the only television credit I had. So the marketing guy goes, \\u201cWell, I was thinking, what about, \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and his amigos\\u2019?\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201c\\u2018Amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWhy \\u2018amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cBecause I have other Mexicans with me?\\u201d And he looked at me and said, \\u201cGood. You get it.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like that. What about \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and friends\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWell, we want to put a couple of buzzwords out there to let the community know what type of show it is.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat type of show is it?\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cIt\\u2019s a special show.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel special.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cGabriel, hear me out. What about like a taco Tuesday?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cOkay, what about salsa night?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cSalsa night?\\u201d \\u201cWait, like dancing or chips and guac?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cEither one, I don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d I could not believe I was having this conversation, and I wanted to get upset. I wanted to go off on this guy for trying to make me feel like less of a person, right? But I didn\\u2019t, because I knew that if I went off on them, I would have been seen as difficult. I would have been seen as a problem, and I would not have been given another opportunity to come back. When people ask me, \\u201cWhat do you credit for your success?\\u201d Of course, talent, showing up, doing what you gotta do. But one word that gets left out a lot is the word \\u201csacrifice.\\u201d I had to sacrifice something that day, and a lot of people think they know what sacrifice means but honestly, until you have to make one, I don\\u2019t think you do. I had to sacrifice my pride because as much as I wanted to go off on this guy, I knew that if I did, I\\u2019d be shooting myself in the foot. I knew that if they could see what I could do on that stage, they\\u2019d have to bring me back, and they\\u2019d have to treat me different.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo as much as it hurt, as much as it sucked, I allowed that stupid taco Tuesday to happen. So, for me, I was very upset. I was wondering, is this something that happens to all new comedians, or was I being singled out? It was killing me. I needed to know. I couldn\\u2019t just take out my phone and google it because that wasn\\u2019t an option all those years back. So what I had to do was I had to go to the front door of the club where they had a bin, and the bin had flyers in it. So I grabbed the flyer, and I looked at it. And the flyer had the list of upcoming comedy shows. And I was so upset when I saw it because all it was, was pictures, names, and television credits. No silly names, no theme nights, no \\u201cspicy this\\u201d or \\u201ccrazy that.\\u201d Just comedy. So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this stupid taco Tuesday thing to me?\\u201d So I said, \\u201cLet me try to find another comedian who\\u2019s a little bit more in my vein.\\u201d If you know what I mean. The only other comedian I could find was a man by the name of George Lopez.\\n[audience cheers]\\nWith George\\u2019s promo, however, it was just a picture, name, and underneath that, a television credit that said, \\u201cAs seen on ABC.\\u201d That\\u2019s it. It didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cLikes to ride a donkey, George Lopez,\\u201d \\u201cEats a burrito with both hands, George Lopez.\\u201d \\u201cAy, ay, ay. I just jumped the wall. It\\u2019s George Lopez.\\u201d No! So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this to me?\\u201d So then I said, \\u201cAll right, all right.\\u201d \\u201cLet me see how they promote the Black comedians.\\u201d And with the Black comedians, it was the same thing. Picture, name, television credit, and that\\u2019s it. Unless it was a show that had multiple Black comedians on it because if the comedy club had a show with three or more Black comics on it, they would put a catchy name to it. They would call the show \\u201cUrban Night\\u201d or \\u201cApollo Night\\u201d or \\u201cDef Jam Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBET Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBlack-ish Comedy Night.\\u201d But that\\u2019s as far as they would go. They wouldn\\u2019t go to the next level like they would for me. Oh, yeah. There was no \\u201cMargarita Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTaco Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWetback Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTortilla Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFiesta Friday,\\u201d or \\u201cS\\u00e1bado Gigante\\u201d! No. That would never happen to Black people. Are you kidding me? You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMalt Liquor Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTupac Tuesday,\\u201d or \\u201cWatermelon Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cThong, Th-Thong, Thong Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFried Chicken Friday\\u201d or \\u201cSookie-Sookie Saturday\\u201d or \\u201cSlap-a-Ho Sunday\\u201d!\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nAnd that most definitely will not happen to white people. [audience chuckling] [scattered cheers] [speaks inaudibly] [cheering grows louder] Oh, I\\u2019mma do the joke. And you know why you can laugh and enjoy and not feel threatened by what I\\u2019m about to say? Because, like what I said earlier tonight, I am here to entertain, I am not here to offend. I\\u2019m here to have fun with everybody, starting with me. Plus, it\\u2019ll never happen. You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMonster Truck Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTrailer Park Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWhite Trash Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTake Your Sister Out Thursday.\\u201d [audience laughs] [in Southern accent] \\u201cOh, hell no, Fluffy! You done crossed the line now!\\u201d \\u201cMy name is Dustin, and I don\\u2019t play that shit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m from Davie, goddammit.\\u201d [audience cheers] Next time, stay quiet. [audience laughs] So\\u2026 I was talking to Martin backstage before I came out, and he goes, \\u201cAre you gonna share the story about the theme nights thing that happened at The Improv here, and y\\u2019know?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, y\\u2019know, I think I should, Martin.\\u201d \\u201cI think I should tell the story about, y\\u2019know, the theme nights.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cGabe, can I tell you something about that theme nights bit?\\u201d I go, \\u201cTell me, Martin.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cDo you realize that in all the years I have heard you tell this story about what happened at that club, do you understand that you\\u2019ve never once finished the week?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cMartin, you know why that is, right?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s the rule of comedy.\\u201d \\u201cYou always want to end on the biggest laugh.\\u201d \\u201cThursday gets the biggest laugh, which is why I stopped at Thursday.\\u201d And Martin goes, \\u201cI know, I know, I know.\\u201d \\u201cBut you\\u2019re robbing white people of their week.\\u201d [audience laughs] I never looked at it that way. \\u201cFox News Friday.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cStorm the Capitol Saturday.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cSay You\\u2019re Sorry Sunday\\u201d! [audience cheers] Are we still havin\\u2019 a good time? [audience cheers] Are we still having fun? [cheering grows louder] That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. People laughing, not getting upset, not getting offended, not freakin\\u2019 making a stink. And let me tell you right now, for the five people who have never heard of me before, this\\u2026 is for you. [scattered cheers] I get pulled over one night, two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-through. [audience cheering knowingly] I made a left turn instead of making a right turn, but I wasn\\u2019t paying attention, \\u2019cause I had a box, right? I was like, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d [chuckles enthusiastically] [exclaims, chuckles] \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d I make a wrong turn all of a sudden. [imitates siren] [groans] [imitates vehicle approaching] [grunts sadly] \\u201cLater.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[gibbers indistinctly] The officer is taking forever. I said, \\u201cForget this.\\u201d I grab the box of donuts. I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. I was like\\u2026 [inhales sharply] Mm! [chuckles] Ah! [exclaims wildly] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou know why I stopped you?\\u201d It was too easy. I picked up the box, and I said\\u2026 [with audience] \\u201c\\u2018Cause you can smell it!\\u201d [audience cheering] [crowd chanting] Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! [audience continues cheering] [chime dings] [Gabriel] You\\u2019re probably wondering, why did we pause the special again? Well, I just want to let you guys know most comedians would\\u2019ve already said, \\u201cThank you, good night,\\u201d gone home, cashed their Netflix checks, and hope they get another phone call. \\u201cPlease call me, Netflix.\\u201d [inhales] But this guy is not most comedians. That\\u2019s what happens when you hire a Mexican. We love overtime. [audience cheering] Thank you for still wanting to hear a joke that\\u2019s over 20 years old. [audience cheers] I grew up watching you too. [audience laughs] Got chills when I\\u2026 [in Spanish] Look, look. [audience laughs] [in English] That was beautiful. I love you too, and that\\u2026 Seriously, you guys, thank you for that. Thank you. [audience cheers] Thank you. There are fans, and then there\\u2019s what you just did right now. [audience cheering] I don\\u2019t know any other comedian that gets this type of love and loyalty. Thank you so much. I\\u2019m not getting off the stage yet \\u2019cause I still got more to go, but I want to say thank you for that. [audience cheers] Thank you. [sighs dramatically]\\n[audience cheering]\\n[Gabriel] Whoo! So when I started doing stand-up in 1997, the only place that would allow me to go up on stage and do what I do were bars. Dive bars, rough bars. Uh, Martin and I, that\\u2019s where we met, many, many years ago. We\\u2019re performing at this bar in Montebello, California, and, uh, you had to fight with the crowd. You had to fight because there was noise. There were TVs on. People were drinking, smoking\\u2026 People were doing everything in there but paying attention. So you had to come out quick, trying to get them to laugh. And one night, this comedian pulls me aside, and he goes, \\u201cHey, kid.\\u201d And when he called me kid, I got upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI could drink.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was 20, 21 years old, and, you know, even though I thought I was grown, I wasn\\u2019t. I wasn\\u2019t grown. Uh, I got upset that he pulled me aside. He goes, \\u201cCan I give you some advice?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWho does this guy think he is? I\\u2019m funnier than him.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I thought because at the age of 21, I was a punk. I really was. And so, I don\\u2019t know what got into me where I said, \\u201cSure, I\\u2019ll hear you out.\\u201d And I just stood there, and he said, \\u201cListen.\\u201d \\u201cUm, you\\u2019re really likeable on stage, and that\\u2019s rare.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna give you a bit of advice.\\u201d \\u201cIf you cut all the cussing out of your show and start taking the filthy material out, I think you\\u2019re gonna have a long career ahead of you.\\u201d And I know I said \\u201ctake the cussing out\\u201d and I\\u2026 I said the F-word twice tonight. [audience chuckles] Technically, no, three times. I said it three times. Um, but I\\u2019m mindful of it. I\\u2019m keeping count. It\\u2019s not every other word. Plus, we\\u2019re in a casino. [audience cheers] Okay. No one loses their ass and says, \\u201cAw, shucks.\\u201d No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI heard some of you cussing before. \\u201cWhen the fuck is this gonna start?\\u201d Yeah, I heard you. I heard you. [in Spanish] I\\u2019m fat, not deaf. [in English] I heard you, goddammit. So anyway, he gives me this advice. Cut the cussing out of your show, take out the filthy material. And I don\\u2019t know why I listen, but I did, and he was absolutely right. All of a sudden, I started getting opportunities left and right. I started getting booked at colleges, high schools, churches, fairs. And then the big one, casinos. [audience cheers] [cheering fades] Back in the day, you had to be squeaky-clean to perform at a casino. Uh, but that\\u2019s not the case anymore. If you can sell tickets, it doesn\\u2019t matter what you do, they want to book you. But back in the day, there was only a few people who could pull it off. I was fortunate to be one of those people. So I remember, I got booked to perform at a casino called Morongo in Southern California, and I\\u2019m backstage with the booker, the lady that hired me for the function, and she goes, \\u201cSo, no cussing, right?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. No cussing.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cNo filthy material?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNo filthy material.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cGood luck.\\u201d And it was just me. I didn\\u2019t have openers. It was just me. It was a voice-over on the frickin\\u2019 speaker, right? \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome comedian, funny man Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d And then I just\\u2026 I walked out there, right? I offended the entire audience\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026in five seconds. And I did it without cussing. Frickin\\u2019 22-year-old kid goes up on stage, looks at the crowd and says, \\u201cHey, everybody! Is this a regular casino, or is this an Indian casino?\\u201d [audience groans and laughs] You see how you all know?\\n[audience laughs]\\nI didn\\u2019t know. I didn\\u2019t know because I didn\\u2019t have TikTok to teach me. [audience chuckles] What I did have was a life experience that I\\u2019ll never forget. As soon as I said that, the entire front row, which comprised of the tribal members from the casino, they all stood up, and one of them called me out in front of the entire audience. \\u201cHey! Hey! You don\\u2019t say that anymore!\\u201d \\u201cThe proper term is Native American.\\u201d \\u201cPlease show respect.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh my God. I\\u2019m so sorry. I didn\\u2019t know.\\u201d And I felt horrible, and I was so embarrassed. Fortunately, I had a second show at ten o\\u2019clock. Ten o\\u2019clock hits. I take the stage. I didn\\u2019t need to be told a thousand times that I messed up. That one time of me getting shamed in front of the entire audience was all I needed. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m a firm believer in shaming. [audience laughs] I think shaming is good. Shaming is good as long as you shame with purpose. If you\\u2019re about to teach someone a valuable lesson, I say go for it because it worked for me. I got shamed one time. Second show, ten o\\u2019clock. I took the stage. Ooh, it was different. I was like, \\u201cBefore I get started, ladies and gentlemen, I\\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Native Americans who are here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cThank you for this opportunity to perform in your casino.\\u201d \\u201cI hope you enjoy the performance.\\u201d [audience cheers and laughs] I thought I was good. All of a sudden, another tribal member in the back jumped up. And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey, drop the \\u2018American\\u2019! Just say \\u2018Native\\u2019!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201c\\u2018Kay!\\u201d [audience laughs] That stayed with me. That was powerful. That was scary. Next time I did a casino, first thing I said was, \\u201cI would like to acknowledge all of the Natives who are here tonight,\\u201d and then someone yelled out, \\u201cWe\\u2019re Indigenous!\\u201d Fuck me! That\\u2019s four. [audience laughs and cheers] [chime dings] With time, I got a chance to perform all across the United States, and then I get my first-ever show in Canada. Ironically enough, at a casino. [audience laughs] It\\u2019s a casino we still perform at called Caesars in the city of Windsor, Ontario, right across the water from Detroit, Michigan. [audience cheers] I come to find out the hard way that in Canada, it is a completely different term for describing the\\u2026 people\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026originally from that land. The proper term in Canada is actually \\u201cFirst Nation.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t know that. I was so nervous being in Canada, I said, \\u201cNative American.\\u201d [audience laughs] Like, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I\\u2019m not even in America, right? Frickin\\u2019 stupid, right? Pendejo, I know. [audience laughs] Fortunately, someone pulled me to the side, and they told me what was up. I was lucky that I had a second show. Ten o\\u2019clock, I take the stage, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBefore I begin, I would like to acknowledge all of the First Nation people who are here tonight.\\u201d Then some guy yells out, \\u201cCall us Indians!\\u201d [audience laughs] This guy in the front row was like\\u2026 [in Indian accent] \\u201cThey\\u2019re not Indian.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[in Indian accent] \\u201cThey are not Indian!\\u201d [as self] Canada has always been an adventure. There was one show that we did at the same casino. Anytime now, we perform outside of the United States, even if it\\u2019s next door in Canada or Mexico, Martin\\u2019s first question to the audience is, \\u201cDo we have any Americans in the house tonight?\\u201d Because no matter where we perform in the world, there\\u2019s always a handful. So that night, Martin takes the stage, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans here tonight?\\u201d Not knowing that earlier in the day, at that same casino, in the grand ballroom, there was a\\u2026 a end-of-year holiday party from an American company from right across the water in Detroit. And they were having this end-of-year celebration, and they were there, pre-gaming since noon. [audience chuckles] Partying it up. And I guess the\\u2026 the party planner for the event thought it would be an amazing idea to end their party with laughter. So this person bought all of the tickets to my show that night and gave them to that company. Well, seven o\\u2019clock rolls around, and everybody stumbles in, takes their seats, and then Martin walks out, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans?\\u201d And instead of getting a \\u201cYay,\\u201d \\u201cWhoo,\\u201d \\u201cRight here,\\u201d he got\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] They were so drunk, they started chanting. \\u201cUSA! USA! USA! USA!\\u201d I\\u2019m in the dressing room, hearing this. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are we here?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cWe could have done this in Detroit.\\u201d You know? I had to fill out paperwork.

Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\\u2013 There\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all.\\n\\u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\\u201d\\nI live\\u2013 I live in New York. I always\\u2013 Like, there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\\u2019s always walking her dog. She\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\\u2013 The two of them, it\\u2019s really\\u2013 The dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\\u2013 And she\\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\\u201910\\u201d, But now it\\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \\u201cyecch, no thank you. \\u201cI do not want those. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \\u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\\u2019s no\\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \\u201cgood morning, gladys,\\u201d She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cgood,\\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \\u201c\\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n\\u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\\u201d\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\\u2019s a weird moment, too, \\u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \\u201cyeah, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \\u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \\u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \\u201cwhy did he die, da\\u2013\\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\\u2019s the reason. That\\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead. He didn\\u2019t know his name, and he didn\\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\\u2019t know which one. I don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\\u2019t. They don\\u2019t care, and we don\\u2019t care. There\\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \\u201cok, everybody. \\u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\\u2013you know what?\\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\\u201d And we would all be like, \\u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\\u201d Anyway, so we\\u2019re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\\u2019s going\\u2013 They\\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \\u201cbaa,\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\\u2019re like\\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 They go\\u2013 My daughter\\u2019s like, \\u201cwhat is he saying?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know! \\u201cI\\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\\u201d\\n\\u201cThe Food Chain\\u201d\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\\u2019re in the food chain. You\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\\u2019s how all life ends, is\\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \\u201cI love you. Bye.\\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \\u201cbeh,\\u201d and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cfine,\\u201d And it\\u2019s just, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\\u2019t get it! Then you\\u2019re walking to work like, \\u201cwhy do I even bother? \\u201cshit! Goddamn it! \\u201cthere\\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\\u201d You think that sharks\\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\\u2019d be bummed \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \\u201chey, nobody has any idea what\\u2019s down here,\\u201d And we\\u2019re all up here like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s totally a shark right there.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\\u2013 \\u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\\u2019s why animals just\\u2013 They go, \\u201clet\\u2019s do this together, man. \\u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\\u201d That\\u2019s why they do it like that. \\u201cfuck it. I\\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cgrownups ain\\u2019t worth the meat.\\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n\\u201cCourtyard Confrontation\\u201d\\nI live in New York city, and it\\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\\u2019m not used to it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\\u2019t get a fountain made without\\u2013 \\u201ccan you make me a fountain?\\u201d \\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll get started right away! \\u201cYes! Yes! It\\u2019s finished!\\u201d And it\\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \\u201cjust piss on me forever!\\u201d Anyway, there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\\u2026 And so I\\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\\u2019s looking at me like, \\u201c\\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \\u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \\u201c\\u201d And then I see him go, \\u201cno. That\\u2019s not gonna do at all,\\u201d And he comes over to me, \\u201c\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNum num num!\\u201d I\\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \\u201crrgh!\\u201d So he comes over, says, \\u201cexcuse me, \\u201cdo you live in this building?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there? I said, \\u201cno.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI just need to rest. I\\u2019m having a hard time.\\u201d He says, \\u201cthis is private property,\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, I don\\u2019t really believe in that.\\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t leave, I\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\\u201d I was like, \\u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\\u201d So he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno,\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \\u201cno. That guy lives here. It\\u2019s OK,\\u201d And the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\\u2013 It was just so\\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings. That\\u2019s how excited I was.\\n\\u201cGetting What \\u2018Old\\u2019 Is\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m 45 now, So I\\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\\u2019t know which one. I won\\u2019t know till it\\u2019s over where this was. I don\\u2019t know how long I\\u2019m gonna live. I don\\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad.\\u201d If I die five years from now, they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cwell, all right,\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 It\\u2019s\\u2013 Like, as soon as you\\u2019re 50, you\\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\\u2019re in the news, and it\\u2019s always some old guy, \\u201cI met Napoleon.\\u201d No, you didn\\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwow, this seems early for this.\\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\\u2019ll realize, \\u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\\u2019s just like, \\u201cJust\\u2013 \\u201d My asshole\\u2013 My asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \\u201crats.\\u201d That\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\\u2019m\\u2013 OK. Say I\\u2019m sitting down. If I\\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\\u2013ha ha ha!\\u2013 I love sitting so much\\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\\u2013 At my age, if I\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \\u201cwhat? Why do I\\u2013 no. Why, though?\\u201d \\u201cYour car is being towed right now!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\\u2019s\\u2013 I accept that.\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \\u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\\u201d Like, let\\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \\u201c\\u201d like I\\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \\u201cshit.\\u201d\\n\\u201cPutting On Socks\\u201d\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\\u2013 Here\\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\\u2019t even know how I do it. I\\u2019m sitting here. I don\\u2019t know how I do that. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 It\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\\u2013 I\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \\u201cbeep, beep, beep!\\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \\u201cOK. That\\u2019s hard.\\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n\\u201cIf You\\u2019re Older You\\u2019re Smarter\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right. It means that even if they\\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\\u2019ve been there longer. If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\\u2019s the interesting thing. There\\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\\u2019t clap. Why? \\u2019cause they\\u2019re smart. They\\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to clap. I don\\u2019t have to do anything.\\u201d They\\u2019re not doing it, and they\\u2019re right. You know why? \\u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m asking. How do you know what\\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\\u2019s every time. \\u201cWhoo! Whoo!\\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\\u2019re not the only people here. That\\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\\u2013 \\u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\\u2019t have it! I don\\u2019t have it!\\u201d If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \\u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\\u2019s seen more. He\\u2019s seen history. He\\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \\u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \\u201cthe president\\u2019s kind of disappointing.\\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n\\u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\\u201d\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \\u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \\u201chey, I\\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\\u201d \\u201cso where do I\\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\\u2019d like to make one of those \\u201cit gets better\\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \\u201clisten, man. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s tough right now. \\u201cYou\\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \\u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \\u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \\u201cbut it gets better because you\\u2019ll all grow up, \\u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \\u201cand they don\\u2019t. \\u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \\u201cand you\\u2019re gonna be there. \\u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \\u201cbefore she hits the ground. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna be so great. \\u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \\u201cto match your looks, but it\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cWhen real shit matters, you\\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\\u201d It\\u2019s just time. That\\u2019s all it takes. There\\u2019s a formula to this. It\\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n\\u201cEverybody Has Their Time\\u201d\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone.\\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\\u2019s all that happens, \\u201caww,\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \\u201cAww.\\u201d Well, go fuck one. \\u201cNah.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t think so. That\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \\u201cyeah. No. You should. I\\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\\u201d\\n\\u201cDating Takes Courage\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\\u2013 It\\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\\u2019t do this!\\u201d But he walked up and said, \\u201chi. Yes,\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\\u201d Sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\\u2019s the whole thing. That\\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \\u201cdude, I can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\\u201d But women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah. I\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\\u201d What are you, nuts? \\u201cI\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\\u201d \\u201cTo your death, statistically.\\u201d How do they still do it? If you\\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI hope this one\\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFirst Date\\u201d\\nI always\\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together And she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha! \\u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\\u2026\\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cthat was good. He\\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\\u201d And he has no idea. He\\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there.\\n\\u201cTits\\u201d\\nGuys are\\u2013 We love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 And we just look at you. That\\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Like they\\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \\u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\\u201d And 100% of us will go, \\u201cyes, of course.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \\u201cyeah. Ok.\\u201d Beep! \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019s not your tits. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 You don\\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit. \\u201cthank you, Deborah. I\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\\u201d It\\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d Which I don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d But that\\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d There\\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that!\\u201d \\u201cthe end.\\u201d \\u201cmy god! \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\\u2013 And you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \\u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\\u201d That\\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\\u2019s, once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\\u2019t get the second one. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit.\\u201d \\u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \\u201cI like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\\u201d And if it\\u2019s up to the guy, we\\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \\u201cyou know what? \\u201cI\\u2019m good with the one. That\\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\\u201d We\\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 \\u201cyeah\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cthere\\u2019s a bomb!\\u201d \\u201cshit! Come on, let\\u2019s get\\u2013 \\u201ccome on! Let\\u2019s get your tits out of here!\\u201d\\n\\u201cDivorce\\u201d\\nI\\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\\u2019ve seen\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 48 maybe. I don\\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\\u2019m not saying don\\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\\u2019s the best part. It\\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \\u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\\u2019s over. I can\\u2019t take it.\\u201d And again, if you\\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\\u2019s just a fact. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s true. Everything\\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\\u2019m a good father. I\\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \\u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\\u2019s like every parent\\u2019s fantasy. Who can\\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \\u201cgood-bye, girls. \\u201cDaddy\\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m such a good dad.\\n\\u201cVideoing Your Kids\\u201d\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\\u2019s there, and everybody\\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \\u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 There\\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \\u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \\u201cmy god! \\u201cit\\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\\u201d And guess what? They\\u2019re not watching it, either. They\\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \\u201cthat\\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\\u201d Nobody\\u2019s watching your kids\\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\\u201d\\n\\u201cLife Is A Good Deal\\u201d\\nDon\\u2019t tape shit on your\\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 Here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything, You just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Every time I\\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \\u201cI could die right now,\\u201d and I mean it! That\\u2019s how good life is. You get to\\u2013 you get to fuck. That\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\\u2019s your buddy. If you\\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\\u2019m not worried about it ending.\\n\\u201cBehind The Wheel\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty good, and I\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\\u2019t know. You know, it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\\u2019re driving, That\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \\u201cworthless piece of shit.\\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \\u201cWorthless piece of shit\\u201d? That\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son. And things I\\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 I don\\u2019t remember, even\\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d? \\u201cworthless piece of shit!\\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d I said that to a person. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d Why? \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\\u2019d like to think that I\\u2019m a nice person, But I don\\u2019t know, man.\\n\\u201cIf Murder Was Legal\\u201d\\nA lot of it is context. There\\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019d love to think, \\u201cI would never do that,\\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause, Like, \\u201cI would never do that.\\u201d No. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\\u2019t like them. \\u201cI never killed anybody.\\u201d \\u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \\u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\\u201d \\u201cI think he\\u2019s nice.\\u201d \\u201cshut up, Janet.\\u201d They would just\\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\\u2019d go to a mall, there\\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\\u2019t listen to me!\\u201d Just\\u2013pbbt! There\\u2019d be just\\u2013 You\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross. \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment. \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of America. \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n\\u201cOf Course, But Maybe\\u201d\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\\u2013 That\\u2019s the thing I believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing, and I don\\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \\u201cof course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \\u201chow did they build those pyramids?\\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\\u2019re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d\\n\\u266a A whole new world \\u266a\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore.\\nI\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d\\nI can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

The special reflects his belief in staying true to his comedic roots\\u2014focusing on entertainment without alienation\\u2014while touching on personal growth, his rise to international fame, and the enduring loyalty of his fans. Through hilarious retellings of real-life situations, including a robbery, his missteps in cultural sensitivity, and navigating life post-breakup, Iglesias showcases his ability to laugh at himself and find humor even in adversity. The show is a testament to his longevity, adaptability, and connection with audiences, offering both laughs and introspection.\\n* * *\\n[crowd cheering]\\n[crowd chanting]\\nFluffy!\\n[cheering stops]\\n[Gabriel] Man, look at this crowd.

They\\u2019re like, [in Spanish] \\u201cI\\u2019m blind!\\u201d [in English] \\u201cIt\\u2019s too much.\\u201d Ah, freaking Mexican DJ Khaled up here. I know, right? Also, I would like to thank, since we\\u2019re here, Only in Dade. Thank you so much. If you know, you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] \\u2026and I think you know. [crowd chuckles] And also, to my friends over at La Carreta for all the food. So\\u2026\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYes. [laughing] Yeah, man. Before we get started, you guys, uh, I would like to thank the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino for the opportunity to record a special. No other entertainer has done a special here yet. Tonight is the first one.\\n[crowd cheering]\\nIt wasn\\u2019t the Rolling Stones. It wasn\\u2019t the Eagles. They trusted a comedian\\u2026 [crowd cheers] \\u2026to make this happen. So I wanna say thank you. Is anybody else staying here at the, uh\\u2026 at the Hard Rock? [crowd cheers] Hey, me too.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a beautiful hotel, and I\\u2019m not just saying that \\u2019cause my room is free. [audience laughs] You know you\\u2019re in a nice hotel and casino when you turn on your TV in your room and they have their own video. Like, if you\\u2019re staying here, you turn on the TV, you get this, [trills tongue] [feminine voice] \\u201cWelcome to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [moans seductively] \\u201cTwenty-four-hour gambling, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\\u201d [moans suggestively] I\\u2019m sitting there like, \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t I stop watching this?\\u201d And I started thinking, at this point, why don\\u2019t they just do that to the slot machines? You know? Gambling\\u2019s already shameless. Might as well go all the way. You walk up to one of the little machines, pop in a 20. [whirring] [moans loudly] [whirring, moans] [feminine voice] \\u201cDon\\u2019t stop.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [audience laughs] People are walking by. \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cTrying to get the jackpot!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] Yeah, man. I\\u2019m gonna start the show off tonight with a question. That\\u2019s not how comedy shows happen, but I\\u2019m gonna start it with a question. The question is, who here tonight has never heard of me up until tonight? [scattered cheering] Five. Two. Five. Okay. To those of you, the five of you, I say, \\u201cSorry.\\u201d I know you got excited. You saw the ticket. You saw the last name, and then I walked out. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cEnrique got bigger.\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why I ask who has never seen or heard of me before is because if you have, then you know the type of show that I do. And you know the type of show that I don\\u2019t do. Like, I\\u2019m not here to tell you who to vote for, who not to vote for, what shot to take or what baby to get rid of. That\\u2019s not for me to say. If you\\u2019re already offended, you missed the point. I\\u2019m telling you what I\\u2019m not gonna do. I promise you, I am here to entertain, not offend. Okay? [audience cheers] We\\u2019re gonna have fun with everybody. Starting with me, but I\\u2019m gonna let you know, we\\u2019re living in a different time. I\\u2019ve been doing this so long, I always figured, as long as I\\u2019m being nice, I shouldn\\u2019t have any issues, but it\\u2019s a very different time. This is year 27 for me.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYeah. Twenty-seven years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I never had to worry. You know, when I first got started, shoot\\u2026 1997, I was clean-shaven, I had hair. I know. Look at some of you. \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d Huh? Vaccine. I know. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kid\\u2026 I\\u2019m kidding. Sorry, Florida. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kidding. I said \\u201cVaccine,\\u201d some of you were like, \\u201cI told you!\\u201d Yeah. [crowd laughs] [in Spanish] \\u201cI told you. He said so.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [in English] Some friends tell me, \\u201cDude, man, you\\u2019re making money now. Why don\\u2019t you get the hair thingy?\\u201d I said, \\u201cFor what?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, some women, they want a guy with hair.\\u201d Well, good for them.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd they\\u2019re not lying. I have gone out with some women that made it a point to tell me that hair was important. One told me flat out, \\u201cI need to be able to run my fingers through your hair.\\u201d Yeah! And I told her, \\u201cHey, look, if you go deep enough\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026you\\u2019re gonna get your wish.\\u201d \\u201cYou were not specific on location. Hey.\\u201d \\u201cYou want hair, you want pelos, I got you.\\u201d But, yeah, 27 years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I have seen a lot of comedians come and go. And I feel very grateful that in all that time, we\\u2019ve still managed to maintain a certain level.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo I feel like we\\u2019re doing something right. Which feels weird to me, because now I feel like you gotta be very mindful. Okay? You gotta be extra mindful. Like\\u2026 Uh, 27 years of being a comedian, I finally started hearing people tell me things that I\\u2019ve never heard before. I started hearing people tell me things like, \\u201cHey, Fluffy. I grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience chuckles] Which is an incredible compliment because that doesn\\u2019t just say that you\\u2019re a fan, that says that you\\u2019re invested. That says that you\\u2019ve been following this career for a very long time. Some of you, the first time you saw me perform, you were kids. [audience cheers] And now some of you are here tonight with your kids. [audience cheers] And so, I just want to say thank you for all those years of trust and continuing to come back to see the show. It means a lot. [audience cheers and applauds] Hearing someone say they grew up watching me, that is one of the most beautiful compliments any entertainer can receive. And I understand that now, with therapy, that that\\u2019s what that means.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nLook, I\\u2019m not gonna lie. The first time I heard someone tell me that they grew up watching me, I didn\\u2019t know how to handle it. I didn\\u2019t know how to process because nobody wants to feel like they\\u2019re getting\\u2026 old. The first time I heard it, I was like\\u2026 [gasps dramatically] Second time I heard it, I was like, \\u201cBuy a hat.\\u201d The third time, I accepted it. I was like, [as old white man\\u2019] \\u201cMany years ago, when I first got started, all of this was land as far as the eye could see.\\u201d \\u201cIt was a very different time, and\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I don\\u2019t know why my old voice is white. [audience laughs] He just is. I tried doing the Mexican voice, but you don\\u2019t take him as serious. [in Spanish] \\u201cWell, screw you.\\u201d \\u201cWe were at the ranch, and were told to fuck off, dude.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s very tough out there.\\u201d [in English] But times are changing. The rules are changing. So I don\\u2019t know how much longer this is gonna be okay. I\\u2019ll tell you what happened to me and why I brought that up. I did a podcast. And before I went into the studio, I\\u2019m talking to the producer outside. And the producer\\u2019s excited and happy, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGabriel Iglesias, we\\u2019re so excited to have you.\\u201d \\u201cThis is really cool.\\u201d \\u201cBefore you go in, the host wanted me to ask you something before you go in for your interview.\\u201d I go, \\u201cSure, go for it.\\u201d \\u201cOkay. What do you identify as?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I wasn\\u2019t sure how to answer that. I\\u2019m 47 years old. I didn\\u2019t know what to say. I was like, \\u201cShit. Hungry, I guess.\\u201d\\nI mean\\u2026\\n[audience laughs] I\\u2019m tired, sleepy, depressed on Tuesdays. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to say. See, here\\u2019s the thing. I knew what she was trying to ask me. I just wasn\\u2019t trying to get involved in a conversation about something that has absolutely nothing to do with me. This was\\u2026 Yeah. [audience cheers] I felt like I was being baited because no matter how I answered that question, I was gonna find myself in an awkward situation. So you know, because for me, I was just like, \\u201cLet me just be funny.\\u201d But nowadays, you can\\u2019t just not answer the question because silence is seen as a problem. And I\\u2019m sorry if me not answering a certain question is considered a problem. I was brought up during a time where you were constantly told to mind your business.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s all I\\u2019m trying to do is stay in my lane. Another thing we were constantly told was always respect your elders. [audience cheers] And no matter what generation you were from, that was at least the one thing we could always agree on until now. Now older people are seen as a problem. They are. You know, and I understand the youth of today has the technology in the palm of their hands, and you can google just about anything, but you cannot google life experience. Okay? You can\\u2019t. You can\\u2019t download struggling. You can\\u2019t download failure. You can\\u2019t download these moments that help build you up to make you a better person. And so again, for me, I chose to stay in my lane and just crack jokes when the girl asked me the question. She got very upset. She got very offended. As soon as I cracked the joke, she was like, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not what I mean.\\u201d \\u201cI mean what are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cFor example, are you a they or them?\\u201d \\u201cA they\\u201d? [audience chuckles] \\u201cOr a them\\u201d? [audience laughs] \\u201cHow fat am I?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhen did I stop being an it?\\u201d Apparently, I ate myself into a plural. That\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience chuckles and applauds]\\nWhat I\\u2019m finding is, even if you have good intentions, and you\\u2019re trying to be cool, you can still find yourself in a situation. So, I\\u2019ll tell you what else happened to me, m\\u2019kay? I was at a McDonald\\u2019s. [audience chuckles] That\\u2019s not even the joke, but okay. [audience laughs] All righty. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHere, this is gonna be good.\\u201d No, no! I was at a McDonald\\u2019s by my house. The McDonald\\u2019s by my house is actually a twofer. It\\u2019s a McDonald\\u2019s on the corner, and it\\u2019s also a gas station. I got a big SUV. I knew it was gonna be a minute. So I said, \\u201cLet me go get some nuggets while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I walk into the McDonald\\u2019s, and as I\\u2019m walking in, I couldn\\u2019t help but notice this homeless family sitting right outside. Now, they didn\\u2019t have a sign. They did not ask me for money, but you could just tell. You could just tell that this poor family is dealing with life. So I get inside, and I said, \\u201cYou know what?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t need anything to eat.\\u201d \\u201cI really don\\u2019t. At this point, it\\u2019s just the habit.\\u201d [audience laughs] I get to the register, and I say, \\u201cYou know what? Let me order some food for the family.\\u201d \\u201cThey got kids with them.\\u201d So I placed an order and the cashier\\u2019s like, \\u201cAnything else?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes. Do you have, um\\u2026 um, Wet-Naps?\\u201d \\u201cExcuse me?\\u201d \\u201cYou know, Wet-Naps to clean your hands.\\u201d \\u201cSir, you\\u2019re more than welcome to use the restroom.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll give you the code.\\u201d \\u201cHere\\u2019s the thing.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s not for me. It\\u2019s for the homeless family that\\u2019s right outside the door.\\u201d \\u201cI want to make sure that the little kids can clean their hands before they eat.\\u201d \\u201cThis food that I just ordered is for them.\\u201d And as we\\u2019re talking\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you. As we\\u2019re talking, the manager at the McDonald\\u2019s is listening in to our conversation. And she walks over. And she\\u2019s all nosy, right? She\\u2019s like, \\u201cExcuse me. I couldn\\u2019t help but overhear.\\u201d \\u201cDid you just say that this food is for the family outside?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I hope that\\u2019s okay.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, it is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cGiving food to people who need food is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cHowever, what you just called them is not okay.\\u201d [audience groans] [as self] \\u201cWhat did I call them?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cYou said\\u2026 homeless.\\u201d [as self] \\u201c\\u2018Cause they are! Look. Shit.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cHe\\u2019s lickin\\u2019 the window!\\u201d [audience laughs] [as manager] \\u201cYou can\\u2019t say that word. It\\u2019s considered offensive.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWho complained?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, well, if I\\u2019m not supposed to say the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019 anymore, what am I supposed to say instead of the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cThe new politically correct term is actually \\u2018unhoused\\u2019 when describing someone in an unfortunate situation like that.\\u201d [audience jeering] [as self] \\u201cYou\\u2019re kidding.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, sir. I\\u2019m not kidding. And please lower your voice.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYou want me to lower my voice when you\\u2019re saying something so ridiculous?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cIf you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly, you are part of the problem, not the solution.\\u201d [audience chuckling] Oh, Miami. I wanted to get ghetto. [audience cheers] I wanted to get ghetto. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I wanted to go full Hialeah on them. [audience cheering] [man] Love you, Fluffy! Thank you for coming, Hialeah. [audience cheers] So yeah, I wanted to go off on her, but I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I wanted to get ghetto, but I couldn\\u2019t because that is the regular McDonald\\u2019s I go to.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nYou know what I\\u2019m saying? I\\u2019m not trying to get banned. The next one\\u2019s far, and gas is a bitch, so I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNah.\\u201d So I looked at her, and I said, \\u201cOkay. We\\u2019re gonna play this game?\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s play this game.\\u201d \\u201cFrom now on, I\\u2019m no longer fat.\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201cAccording to you, I am now \\u2018unexercised.'\\u201d [audience laughs] [audience cheering] I did, bro. She looked at me, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t be ridiculous.\\u201d And I looked at her, and I was like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d \\u201cOh, well, if you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly you are part of the problem.\\u201d \\u201cNot the solution.\\u201d [audience cheers] And I grabbed the food, and I walked out. Now, second half of the story. I walk over to the family. M\\u2019kay? And I hand the bags of food to the mom. And the mom was so nice. She was just happy that someone thought of her and her kids. She got very emotional. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI just want to say thank you.\\u201d \\u201cYou have no idea what you\\u2019re doing for us right now.\\u201d \\u201cThis really means a lot.\\u201d \\u201cThank you.\\u201d And I had to ask the question. [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I know what you thought. Some of you are like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it.\\u201d Oh, I did it. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. Watch. So, I looked, and I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d And she was like, \\u201cNo, unfortunately. We\\u2019re not okay. We\\u2019re not.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been homeless now for four days.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you heard.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cBut, uh\\u2026\\u201d No, not\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience chuckles] I didn\\u2019t correct her \\u2019cause I\\u2019m not a dick. That\\u2019s why I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience laughs] That\\u2019s what I mean, you guys. Even if you have good intentions nowadays, people can take what you\\u2019re saying or doing and twist it to make you look bad. There should be no consequences for being kind, for trying to help, for wanting to do the right thing, for caring. Unfortunately, we\\u2019re still consumed by this word called \\u201cliability\\u201d that sometimes we forget to be a little human, and that\\u2019s unfortunate. I\\u2019m not trying to get on a soapbox about this. I\\u2019m trying to let you know some things I\\u2019ve been dealing with, and I\\u2019m just here to report. [audience chuckles] The thing with me now is that after 27 years of being a comedian, every time I walk out the door, the light is officially on. In the sense that every time I leave my house, there is a slight chance I could make the news. For example, did Martin talk about how, uh, he fell off the stage earlier in the show?\\n[crowd] Yeah.\\nOkay. Okay, cool. Uh, for the home audience, Martin, he fell a while back. He talked about it. I know you didn\\u2019t see it, \\u2019cause your subscription only covers so much.\\nUm, yeah.\\n[audience laughs] You can watch the first half on Prime. I think it\\u2019s on Prime. Maybe you can just see it there then come back and check out the rest. So, long story short, we were doing a show in Phoenix, Arizona, and Martin accidentally fell off of a stage this high, and he broke his foot. Now, the incredible part about Martin is that he got up, and on adrenaline, ran around, got back up on stage, and performed. And then was taken to the hospital after he walked off stage. He is a professional. [audience cheers] Seriously, that is a pro. Much respect \\u2019cause if it would have been me\\u2026 [audience chuckles] If I would\\u2019ve fallen off stage, and the staff was like, \\u201cWhat about the fans?\\u201d \\u201cWell, bye, Felicia.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhat do we tell \\u2019em?\\u201d \\u201cRefund.\\u201d [audience laughs] But see, the difference is Martin had to tell you he fell for you to know he fell. And by the way, I saw the fall. I saw. He came out and just kind of tripped over a cord backstage, came through the curtain already, you know. And then, you know\\u2026 \\u201cMartiiin!\\u201d [imitates thud] Women in the front row were like, \\u201cHe fell for me.\\u201d [audience laughs] I\\u2019m glad you laughed. I said that last night and some guy was like, \\u201cAw.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cWhy \\u2018aww\\u2019?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s your friend.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cExactly. That\\u2019s why I make fun of him.\\u201d That is the mark of a true friendship, is being able to say real evil things about each other. [audience cheers] Because you know you don\\u2019t really mean it. Plus, you don\\u2019t think that if I would\\u2019ve fallen off the stage instead of Martin that he wouldn\\u2019t\\u2019ve had a joke? You better believe he would have had a joke. He would have told people, \\u201cI saw Fluffy bounce.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot to mention the fact that you know that\\u2019ll make the news. I fall off the stage tonight, there\\u2019ll be a van out in front in an hour. \\u201cWe\\u2019re standing here live in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, where authorities believe Fluffy lost control.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to Tom, who\\u2019s inside the venue who can fill us in with more.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, Jim, I\\u2019m standing here at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, inside the venue where apparently Fluffy took a spill.\\u201d \\u201cIt is still uncertain as to what happened here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cWe did have a chance to interview local authorities who had this to say.\\u201d \\u201cDamn!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt is still uncertain if there was any problems with the stage.\\u201d \\u201cWe did speak to security who had this to comment.\\u201d \\u201cI saw the whole damn thing. Okay?\\u201d \\u201cWhoo! Fluffy fell. He fell hard.\\u201d \\u201cI ain\\u2019t seen that many white people cry since a Taylor Swift concert.\\u201d \\u201cIt was bad. It was bad. And in Miami. Are you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cHe hurt more Cubans than Castro.\\u201d [audience laughs] And that\\u2019s how you get canceled. So, uh, that\\u2019s the point I\\u2019m trying to make here. I made the news recently. Uh, without giving too much away, there\\u2019s an episode of Family Feud coming out very soon that I\\u2019m gonna be on. Yeah.\\n[audience applauds]\\nIt is the celebrity edition, so it\\u2019s Fluffy and Fluffy\\u2019s family versus Fat Joe\\u2026 [audience gasps] \\u2026and his family. So yeah, it\\u2019s Fat Joe versus Fluffy because apparently, the producers have a great sense of humor. [audience laughs] Long story short, I flew in some family from the East Coast to be on the show. The show went over very well. You\\u2019ll find out who wins later. Here\\u2019s the deal. The next day, my sister, who was one of the people I flew in, she hadn\\u2019t been in California in forever, and she was like, \\u201cCan we go to Disneyland?\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cSure, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d So it was her and her husband Gordy, and I took them to Disney. And we get on a couple of rides, and just so we\\u2019re clear, that\\u2019s not what made the news. [audience chuckles] I said that last night, someone was like, \\u201c\\u2018Cause he fit.\\u201d No!\\n[audience laughs]\\nSome people. Right? Yeah. We get on the Cars ride at California Adventure, and halfway through the Cars ride, the car\\u2026 [imitates engine revving, brakes screeching] \\u2026stops on the track. And my sister looked at me. She goes, \\u201cIs this supposed to happen?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, the check cleared. We\\u2019re supposed to finish. This is, uh\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWe paid. It\\u2019s supposed to work. No, this\\u2026\\u201d It took the Disney people about 20 minutes to come get us and take us out of the car. So we\\u2019re sitting there, outside, in the sun for 20 minutes. I had no problem with that because I am mocha. I\\u2019m okay in the sun for 20 minutes. My sister, she\\u2019s twice as dark as me. She\\u2019s, like, freaking, you know, Apache. She\\u2019s\\u2026 You know. Freaking Azteca. [chanting] Just, you know\\u2026 Her husband, on the other hand, he\\u2019s from Minnesota. [audience laughs] He almost died.\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cOh, don\\u2019 cha know?\\u201d Yeah, so\\u2026 while we\\u2019re sitting there in the car, waiting for the Disney people to come take us out of the car, the people waiting in line realize that the ride has been shut down. And so from the ride, you can see the line. People see the car on the track, and then they see who\\u2019s in the car. [audience chuckles] And all of a sudden, cell phones start comin\\u2019 out. And by the time we left Disney, TMZ had already reported the story, and you can google this, okay? TMZ reported the story. Before we left the park, it said, \\u201cFluffy Stuck on LA Freeway at Disney.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I thought it was cute. I thought it was silly. I thought it was funny. I thought it was okay. Until I read the comments. [audience chuckles] Oh, some of you\\u2026 are dicks. [audience laughs] One lady wrote, \\u201cJust \\u2019cause you\\u2019re tall enough to ride doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re small enough to fit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nA guy wrote, \\u201cThe car got tired.\\u201d [audience laughs] Another guy wrote, \\u201cYou\\u2019re Mexican. Couldn\\u2019t you fix it?\\u201d [audience laughs] And that was Martin, yeah. So\\u2026 [audience laughs] [imitates rim shot] Anyway, so\\u2026 The time before that, we made world news. Some of you might remember this story. The guys and I were involved in an emergency landing situation. I had, uh, chartered a private jet because my last Netflix special, the money finally hit my account, and I, you know, freakin\\u2019\\u2026 I thought I was, y\\u2019know, ballin\\u2019, right? Nope. Turns out we were fallin\\u2019! Worst turbulence we have ever experienced in 27 years of being comedians. Uh, worst turbulence I ever felt, for sure. At one point, the jet did this.\\n[whooshes]\\n[audience chuckles] I did this.\\n[imitates thud]\\n[audience chuckles] The scariest part was watching my dogs leave the seat. Fortunately, we landed safely. We were okay. That\\u2019s not what made the news. What made the news is that, when we came in for the landing, the jet touched down, and then it skid off the runway by 200 yards, and we ended up in a field. A field. A field! Are you kidding me? As hard as I work\\u2026 [audience laughs] [audience applauds] \\u2026to break stereotypes. [audience laughs] A bunch of Mexicans ended up in a field. Yeah, that\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat\\u2019s how TMZ reported it. \\u201cMexicans Found in Field.\\u201d [audience chuckles] In the movies, the pilots are always the first to know when there\\u2019s an issue. And in the movies, the pilots always have the courtesy of telling the passengers. They love to hear themselves talk. They get on the mic, \\u201cAll right. It\\u2019s your captain speaking here.\\u201d \\u201cI just want to let you know we\\u2019ll be experiencing rough air.\\u201d \\u201cIf you could just fasten your seatbelts, we\\u2019re gonna be A-okay. All right\\u2026\\u201d [murmurs] You know? If it gets bumpy, you know, [whooshing] [as captain, mumbling] \\u201cIt\\u2019s your captain speaking.\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just had a little Mexican food here, so we\\u2026 we\\u2019re feeling a little bumpy up here.\\u201d \\u201cWe just had some fast food.\\u201d \\u201cJust a reminder to keep your seat belts fastened.\\u201d \\u201cWe might be getting a bit\\u2026 There we go. Just a bit there.\\u201d [laughs] \\u201cAll right, I\\u2019ll be back with you in just a few seconds\\u2026\\u201d [mumbles indistinctly] If the plane\\u2019s going down, \\u201cBrace for impact!\\u201d \\u201cHold on tight! We\\u2019re comin\\u2019 in hot!\\u201d Our pilot\\u2026 nada.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOur pilot didn\\u2019t say anything until we came to, like, a complete stop. And then maybe like a minute later, the cockpit door opened up, and he stuck his head in, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou good?\\u201d [audience laughs] I was like, \\u201cMy chihuahua\\u2019s in a cup holder. I am not good.\\u201d It was a scary situation, you guys, but let me tell you, even though we were involved in an emergency landing and we thought we were gonna die, I\\u2019m grateful for the experience. Believe it or not. I\\u2019m grateful because it reminded me how valuable life is and how quickly things can change.\\n[audience applauds]\\nEvery now and then, we need a little reminder. We need to get shaken up a little to remind ourselves, \\u201cOh my God. This is special.\\u201d \\u201cThis is important. Enjoy it. Have fun.\\u201d The rest of the day after the landing, there was nothing anybody could tell me to ruin how good I felt to just be breathing and be alive. Nothing! [audience cheers and applauds] And so, that\\u2019s why I, uh\\u2026 I\\u2019m grateful for bad moments. And I think bad moments are actually a good thing because we need balance in life. You need to have bad experiences in order to truly appreciate good experiences. Not every day can be the same. [audience applauds] You need to have a way to ba\\u2013 Now, don\\u2019t get me wrong. Sometimes there\\u2019s too many bad days in a row. That shit sucks. And that\\u2019s actually what happened to me. After the near-death experience, I go home. I go home to find out that someone broke into my house. [audience gasps] Yeah. Yeah, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I survived? To see this shit?\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why you haven\\u2019t heard about it until now is because the detective who\\u2019s working the case told me I\\u2019m not allowed to talk about it. In California.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah, if the guys that broke into my house are here tonight\\u2026 [scoffs] \\u2026bravo. [sarcastically] Bravo. That\\u2019s a flex and a half. No, they broke into my house, and of course, the number one question is, \\u201cWhat did they take from your house?\\u201d And what they took from me, honestly, it was my peace of mind. I didn\\u2019t feel safe in that house after. Uh, but if you must know, I did everything to prevent a break-in. I had, first of all, a good neighborhood. I had an alarm. I had two camera systems. I had a fence that surrounded the property. I thought I was good. Um, I got video footage of the entire robbery.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIn 4K. [audience chuckles] Oh, that shit is crisp. I saw the guys that broke in, but I could not identify them because they were wearing masks. All I can tell you about the two guys that broke into my house is that they were 20 years old. I know they were 20 because when they jumped the fence and hit the ground, no pain.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf that would\\u2019ve been a 35-year-old with messed-up sciatica, he\\u2019d have thought twice about that fence. So, they jumped the fence, went in the backyard, and they broke the window and got in through the kitchen. They trashed my house. Okay, every drawer, open. Every cabinet, open. Everything got pulled out onto the floor so they could sift. Uh\\u2026 Couches were flipped over, cushions were thrown down, and they pulled every single frame off the wall. And I asked the detective, I said, \\u201cHey, look. I understand the drawers, the cabinets, and even the couch thing.\\u201d \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the story with the frames on the wall?\\u201d \\u201cWhy did they take everything off the wall but didn\\u2019t take any frames?\\u201d \\u201cSome of that stuff was art.\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cMr. Iglesias, you have to understand something about these people that broke into your home.\\u201d \\u201cThey were not looking for photos or art.\\u201d \\u201cThey were actually looking for a safe.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cYes, sir. A safe.\\u201d \\u201cA lot of times, in these homes, people will put a hole in the wall, install a safe, and then they\\u2019ll hang a frame over the safe to disguise that their valuables are in there.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d\\n[audience chuckles]\\n[as cop] \\u201cSir, yes, a safe.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cBut I just got this money.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cDid they check the mattress?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as cop] \\u201cDon\\u2019t know.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s find out!\\u201d So, we walk into the master bedroom. I grab the edge of the bed, right? And I picked it up, and I was like, \\u201cAh, stupid!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all here.\\u201d Oh my God. These guys had no idea they were robbing somebody more ghetto than them. [audience laughs] So, at the end of it, they only got a couple of little trinkets from the drawers. Um, and that\\u2019s pretty much it. They made a mess of the house. They didn\\u2019t get any of the money. I\\u2019ll tell you what they did get. They got my guns. [audience exclaims] Now\\u2026 I have never been open about the fact that I am, in fact, a registered gun owner.\\n[audience cheers]\\nRelax, Florida. [audience laughs] I\\u2019ve never been open about it because, quite frankly, it\\u2019s nobody\\u2019s business. Okay? However, it does pertain to the story that I\\u2019m about to share with you. Um, I am a recent gun owner. I became a gun owner in 2020, m\\u2019kay? Uh, yeah, when we were in the middle of\\u2026 [loudly] \\u2026it. [audience laughs] Every morning watching the news, we didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen, and it started to feel irresponsible, not preparing myself for a worst-case situation. Every morning watching the news, it felt like we were headed towards the Purge. [audience chuckles] Some of you are laughing, but think about this, the Purge would have taken less time. [audience chuckles] Yeah, the Purge. That\\u2019s how they should\\u2019ve woke us up, at least for entertainment purposes. [imitates alarm sounding] [feminine voice] \\u201cI\\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in the pandemic.\\u201d \\u201cThe local time is 7:45 a.m.\\u201d [moans seductively]\\n[audience laughs]\\nFear is why I decided to buy a gun. I was afraid, and I got no problem saying that. I was scared. We didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen. Um, it\\u2019s only for protection. I don\\u2019t hunt. I don\\u2019t want to hunt. I don\\u2019t need to. I know where there\\u2019s three Chick-fil-As. [audience laughs] I\\u2019m good. I don\\u2019t go out on the weekends, you know? Pull! [imitates rifle firing] There\\u2019s no\\u2026 [quacking] I still own a Nintendo. I don\\u2019t need that shit. Fear is the only reason why I decided to buy a gun. So, I wound up at this sporting goods store right by my house. I walk in there, and this place is packed full of people that normally would not have been open to the idea of owning a gun, but they felt like me. They were scared, and rightfully so. I kept hearing the same conversation over and over and over. I kept hearing this\\u2026 \\u201cI would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it.\\u201d [audience cheers] [audience applauds] And I don\\u2019t care where you\\u2019re from, that makes a lot of sense. And I was not about to let politics interfere with my personal safety. So, next thing you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] So, next thing you know, I got in line. I had to get a ticket with a number like when you\\u2019re at the DMV or meat market. [in Spanish] The butcher shop. The bodega. \\u201cNumber five!\\u201d [in English] I got in line. Forty-five minutes, I waited in line. And as soon as I get to the front, this guy comes to the counter, and he\\u2019s like\\u2026 [in Southern accent] \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, um\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I heard some of you chuckle, and just so we\\u2019re clear, I\\u2019m not saying that\\u2026 all people [sighs] \\u2026who sell guns\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u2026talk like that. [audience laughs] But his name was Jim. [audience laughs] So, Jim was like, \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m here to see about purchasing my first firearm.\\u201d \\u201cWell, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Know what you want?\\u201d \\u201cOr you need a hand?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019ve had some time to look at your selection, and I think I found something that\\u2019s gonna work for me.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. Show me what you got.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, right over here in the case.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, right here.\\u201d \\u201cThis one. The one right here, in the front.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. Not that one. This one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. This one. Not that one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. The one in front.\\u201d \\u201cWith the tag. The tag. Right here. The one that says two-two.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cUm, sir, did you just call that gun\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cYeah. What?\\u201d \\u201cJi\\u2026 Jim, right? Jim? Jim.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at me like I\\u2019m crazy, dude. I\\u2019m just reading the tag.\\u201d \\u201cIt says it right here. In the front. It says two-two.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou mean a .22?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, yeah. I guess. Two-two, .22, same thing.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, I hate to break it to you, but there\\u2019s a big difference between a tutu and a .22.\\u201d \\u201cBut hey, this is California, so whatever floats your boat, son.\\u201d \\u201cAll right?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cNow, is there any particular reason why you have selected a, uh\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cWell, um, as impressive as your selection of guns here is, I recognize a lot of them from movies.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s a bit much for me.\\u201d \\u201cUm, I\\u2019m very simple.\\u201d \\u201cUm, this gun looks very manageable.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s small and, you know, it looks easy.\\u201d \\u201cPlus, it\\u2019s on sale.\\u201d \\u201cYou know what I mean? Come on, man.

She\\u2019ll never find me here.\\u201d \\u201cSo, this bullet, when it comes out the chamber, it opens up.\\u201d \\u201cAnd when it hits, it\\u2019ll leave a hole about yay big.\\u201d And stupid me, I said this, I said, \\u201cPeople survive that?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as Jim] \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSon, you don\\u2019t want \\u2019em to survive.\\u201d \\u201cYou want \\u2019em dead as fried chicken, as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\u201d [audience applauds] I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anybody to die.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want anybody to die?!\\u201d \\u201cYou guys hear that?\\u201d \\u201cYou hear that?

I felt that. I felt it.\\u201d Um\\u2026 \\u201cIf I\\u2019m cornered like that, and I have absolutely no choice, and my life is in danger, I promise you, Jim, I will step up, man, and I will shoot them right in the leg.\\u201d \\u201cI will.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cYou think you\\u2019re gonna hit the leg, Mr. First-Time Gun Owner?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHey, if I buy that bullet you\\u2019re trying to sell me, that covers that much, up close, I can hit a leg.\\u201d \\u201cTwo steps closer, I\\u2019ll shoot him in the huevos. I will, dude.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll hit a pelota. I will. No more babies, man.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. All right. You don\\u2019t gotta get graphic on me, now.\\u201d \\u201cSon, you know what\\u2019s gonna happen if you shoot someone in your home, in the leg, and they live?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I know.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sleep better, knowing I didn\\u2019t take a life and I was able to protect my home, my family, and my stuff.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen.\\u201d [as Jim] Ah. \\u201cClearly, you\\u2019re a Disney fan.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cThat\\u2019s about the biggest fantasy I\\u2019ve ever heard, right there.\\u201d \\u201cSon, I would ask you if you knew, but clearly, you don\\u2019t, so I\\u2019m not gonna waste my time spinnin\\u2019 my wheels on this one.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna call it like it is.\\u201d \\u201cIf you shoot someone in your home and they live, they can come back and sue your ass.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. Now, here\\u2019s the kicker.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. They\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cAnd not only are they gonna get everything they wanted to get when they first broke in, when it\\u2019s all said and done, you are gonna cut them a big fat check.\\u201d \\u201cNow, what do you got to say about that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat motherfucker\\u2019s gonna die!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nHe got excited. [as Jim] \\u201cNow, we\\u2019re talkin\\u2019!\\u201d I found out something that day. I found out that people that sell guns are a lot like people that sell used cars. They play on your emotions, and then they start to upsell you and make you buy things you don\\u2019t want or need. He knew I was scared because he kept saying it to me. [as Jim] \\u201cI know you\\u2019re scared.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re scared, and your fears. You\\u2019re worried. You\\u2019re scared.\\u201d Every time he\\u2019d say \\u201cscared,\\u201d something else appeared on the counter. [audience laughs] He sold me so well that when he was done \\u201cselling me,\\u201d I wound up with four rifles\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026and four handguns and a case\\u2026 a case of spreader ammunition. [audience chuckles] I hear some of you clapping, and why? It\\u2019s excessive. I only have two hands. [audience laughs] See, I feel, again, even though my home was burglarized, I feel grateful because I wasn\\u2019t there and I had my dogs with me. I can\\u2019t replace my dogs. I can\\u2019t replace me. [audience cheering] Stuff is stuff. However, if I would have been home, I would have done whatever I needed to do. That\\u2019s the difference. In this situation, there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me, had the guns, had the ammo, glad they weren\\u2019t there, but if they were there, they would\\u2019ve done something about it. \\u2018Cause if I was in bed and I heard the\\u2026 [imitates crashing] \\u2026I would\\u2019ve jumped up. [grunting] I would\\u2019ve grabbed my gun. [imitates gun cocking] I would\\u2019ve ran out into the living room with no shirt on and one sock off.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI\\u2019d have confronted the person. \\u201cFreeze!\\u201d Knowing my luck\\u2026 [audience chuckles] [as burglar] \\u201cFluffy?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI said, freeze!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re funny. You\\u2019re funny, bro.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re funny.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cGet on the ground!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh!\\u201d [as self] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make me shoot you.\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cAh, hey!\\u201d [exclaims] \\u201cHey, Beto, get in here! Get in here! You\\u2019ll never guess whose house this is!\\u201d The other guy runs in. [as Beto] \\u201cOh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey.\\u201d \\u201cI grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience laughs and cheers] Next thing you know, I\\u2019m autographing things they\\u2019re about to take. [audience chuckles] [mouthing inaudibly] [audience laughs] [continues mouthing] [audience laughs] So like I said, in this situation, I feel like there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me. Had the guns, had the ammunition. Glad they weren\\u2019t home, but if they would have been home, they would have done something about it. That\\u2019s one type of people. The other kind of people are the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to\\u2026\\n[scattered cheering]\\nOh. Good. You\\u2019re here. [audience laughs] The kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to confront an intruder because you know you have way more guns and ammunition than they do, and you are prepared for war. [audience cheers] The kind of people who sit home at night in the living room, in the dark, holding their gun.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[imitates rifle cocking] They leave the front door unlocked to make it easier. [audience laughs] And people like that always have a friend either across the street or across town. \\u201cHow is everything over there on your side?\\u201d [imitating radio static] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all clear over here. How about you?\\u201d \\u201cYeah. Coast is clear. Ten-four. Out.\\u201d There. This situation, the break-in, left me traumatized. I couldn\\u2019t go back to living in the house because I didn\\u2019t feel safe. It\\u2019s just me and two chihuahuas. Yeah, that\\u2019s it. I\\u2019m no longer with my son\\u2019s mom, and my son lives with his mom. So, you know\\u2026 And by the way, I told my son Frankie what happened, about the break-in, and right away, right away, \\u201cOh, really? They\\u2019re lucky I wasn\\u2019t there.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cC\\u00e1lmate, John Wick.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThey would\\u2019ve kidnapped you.\\u201d \\u201cI would\\u2019ve had to pay double to get you back.\\u201d I could not go back to living at the house. Again, it\\u2019s just me. So, I put the house up for sale. Uh, yeah, I just couldn\\u2019t. And it was a big beautiful home that you guys helped pay for. Thank you. [audience chuckles] It was nice. Real nice. Freaking four bathrooms. Four bathrooms. Yeah. One penis.\\n[audience laughs]\\nEven if I ran, I couldn\\u2019t, you know\\u2026 I put the house up for sale, and here\\u2019s the dilemma that I faced. I put it up for sale before I had a new place to live because I figured I\\u2019m on the road, I\\u2019m always in a tour bus, a plane, a hotel, always somewhere. I\\u2019m on the go. I was just trying to get ahead of it because when I first bought the house, it was sitting on the market for almost two years. So I thought I had time. What happened was it sold like that because I had two people bidding on the house at the same time and they kept driving up the price. And one of the people trying to buy the house, he wanted all of my furniture and so my agent for the house goes, \\u201cGabriel, this is crazy.\\u201d \\u201cThese two guys are bidding on your house, and they want to give you way more than what you\\u2019re asking.\\u201d \\u201cOne of them wants to give you an extra $100,000 for all of your furniture.\\u201d \\u201cI suggest you take it.\\u201d And so, I did. I sold the house with everything, except the mattress. Everything. The problem is I don\\u2019t have a house right now. I don\\u2019t have anywhere to live, so technically, I\\u2019m, um\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\nFuck it. I\\u2019m homeless. I don\\u2019t care. [audience cheers] I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019m not gonna be \\u201cunhoused.\\u201d I\\u2019m homeless right now. They can\\u2019t cancel me. What are they gonna do? Take my house? I don\\u2019t have one. Ha! [audience laughs] So whatever. Mm. But no, at this point, at\\u2026 at 47 years of age, I don\\u2019t need more stuff. I\\u2019m happy that I do have stuff, but I don\\u2019t need it. What I want more than anything else now is better relationships. Better friendships, better people in my life, that\\u2019s what I want more than anything else. I announced in my last special at Dodger Stadium that I was no longer in a relationship. And I thought that was the best place to announce that because I\\u2019ve been very open about my life, my whole show is my life. People kept asking about her. So I thought that was the best place to announce that. You know what happens when you tell 50,000 people at a stadium that you\\u2019re single and then Netflix airs that around the world? I received thousands of \\u201capplications\\u201d for the Fluffy fulfillment center. Yes, I did. [chime dings] [Gabriel] That\\u2019s right, Netflix. Fluffy is hoein\\u2019 out. [audience chuckles] It was incredible. It was exciting. It was overwhelming, And it was terrifying because I didn\\u2019t know what they wanted. Um, well, I\\u2019m gonna tell you that since announcing that I was single, I\\u2019ve gone out on a few dates. And, uh, yeah. I don\\u2019t want to say how many, \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t want your judgment. [chuckles] \\u201cFluffy\\u2019s a whore.\\u201d [in English and Spanish] \\u201cHe\\u2019s nasty.\\u201d [in English] \\u201cHe\\u2019s like Santa with all his ho ho hos, yeah.\\u201d I still want to go out. I still want to have fun, I want to make connections, but unfortunately, I don\\u2019t trust people. I\\u2019m afraid. I can meet people really easy, but then I find out what they\\u2019re up to, and that sucks. Um, my heart is guarded now. Super guarded. There\\u2019s a wall and then a wall and then a wall and a wall and a wall. I\\u2019m like the only Mexican who likes walls.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo moving forward, I can tell you I don\\u2019t want to be in another relationship. I\\u2019m actually doing okay. I still want to go out, but I don\\u2019t want to be in a committed relationship. I\\u2026 I don\\u2019t. No.\\n[man boos]\\n[grunts] What do you mean, \\u201cBoo\\u201d? The fact that I\\u2019m being honest about that I don\\u2019t want to be in a relationship, I think there\\u2019s something to be said about that. I could easily lie. Meet someone, say that we\\u2019re boyfriend/girlfriend, and have a thing. But does it mean anything if your behavior doesn\\u2019t change? I\\u2019m being up front and honest. All I want\\u2026 All I want\\u2026 All I want, watch\\u2026 To the guy that booed me for saying I don\\u2019t want a relationship. Raise your hand so I can\\u2026 Okay, you\\u2019re famous, so\\u2026\\nTo you\\u2026 What is your name?\\n[man] Justin.\\nJustin?\\nDustin. Dustin. All right, Dustin. Sorry for\\u2026 \\u201cDustin!\\u201d Like, all right, \\u201cChill, bitch.\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, right? Freakin\\u2019 \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [Gabriel and audience laugh] All right, Dustin. Me not wanting to be in a traditional relationship is a honest thing because, uh, I can tell you, I don\\u2019t want to be in a situation where I\\u2019m obligated to participate in things that don\\u2019t make me feel like a good person. And at the age of 47, I\\u2019m tired of arguing, yelling, feeling guilted, feeling obligated, not smiling more. [audience cheers] I\\u2019m good, man. I\\u2026 You know\\u2026 But I still want to go out. So I just want to be up front and honest. All I need, Dustin, watch, is someone to eat with. [audience cheers] Someone to drink with. Someone to go to movies with. And someone to cuddle with. [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And they don\\u2019t even gotta be the same person.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll I\\u2019m saying is sometimes it takes a village. Okay? Dustin, I would love to tell a woman, \\u201cHey, would you like to go see a movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cYeah.\\u201d Then we go. After the movie\\u2019s over, I go, \\u201cWhat did you think?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cRight?\\u201d \\u201cWould you like to see another movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cSure. When?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNext week?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s stay in touch. See you next week.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna be so cool. You like rom-coms. I like rom-coms.\\u201d \\u201cYou like horror movies. I like horror.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna work. I like this. I need this. [grunts] Can\\u2019t wait.\\u201d So I say, \\u201cAll right, gotta go.\\u201d And she gets weird. [as woman] \\u201cWait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.\\u201d \\u201cYou gotta go? I thought this was going good.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s going great. We\\u2019ll do more next week. This is cool.\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the rush?\\u201d \\u201cWhere are you headed? Where you going?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cUh, I\\u2019m about to call the cuddler. Why?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as woman] \\u201cThe cuddler, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI got that covered.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, movies, that\\u2019s your lane. Stay in it, okay?\\u201d \\u201cThis is us. We\\u2019re good. Solid. You\\u2019re the movie girl, okay?\\u201d Now, Dustin. I didn\\u2019t tell her. But I\\u2019m gonna tell you. When it comes to the department of cuddling, and this is so crazy because I\\u2019ve always been in a relationship and I could never be this open and honest, but now that I\\u2019m single, these are Fluffy\\u2019s flavors. [audience laughs] So, when it comes to the department of cuddling, this is what I want. I want a woman. A woman. A woman. With original factory settings. [audience laughs and cheers] [speaks indistinctly] This woman needs to be equal to, or greater than, in size. She needs to be a big girl. I prefer a big girl.\\nI want a big girl.\\n[audience cheers] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. This way, we both can agree on the temperature of the thermostat. [audience laughs and applauds] And only big girls know what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. [audience laughs] See, I\\u2019m a big boy, and as a big boy, I always run hot. Heat affects my mood. When I\\u2019m hot, Dustin, I become irritable, cranky, my anxiety goes through the roof. So for me to feel comfortable, I like to set the room to 68 degrees. Okay? [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And only a big girl can truly appreciate that. Skinny women, not so much. And let me tell you, I am tired of disappointing, skinny, cold women. [audience laughs] Skinny, cold women are mean. They\\u2019re mean. They don\\u2019t want it at freakin\\u2019 68 degrees. No, they want 72, 73, 74. [in Spanish] You\\u2019re killing me. No! [in English] But I can\\u2019t do that to them. I can\\u2019t put them in 68 degrees. They get snippy. They get evil. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh my God. What\\u2019s your problem?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cWell, fuckin\\u2019 eat something.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] \\u201cI\\u2019m tired of sweating.\\u201d But, yeah. Anyway, Dustin, I apologize. I wasn\\u2019t trying to turn this into a TED Talk. [audience chuckles] I don\\u2019t want you to think that I don\\u2019t believe in love because I do, and anyone who can pull it off, I commend you for it. I have met so many couples over the years. I\\u2019ve met 20-year couples, 30-year couples, 40-year couples, 50-year couples. I met one 55.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. Yeah. I call them unicorns. I\\u2019ll tell you the story. I was in Savannah, Georgia. And I had just finished filming the second Magic Mike movie. Now\\u2026 Yeah, I know. For those of you that don\\u2019t know, I was in Magic Mike. [audience cheers] Yes. I know. I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. [audience laughs] Magic Mike, not Tragic Mike. So, let\\u2019s remember that, okay? I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. So, um\\u2026 Here\\u2019s the thing, after the movie, after we wrapped, my manager, Joe, tells me, he says, \\u201cDude, man.\\u201d \\u201cCongratulations on another project.\\u201d \\u201cI want to take you out for a steak dinner.\\u201d I said, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d So he takes me to this restaurant called Ruth\\u2019s Chris Steak House. Now, very popular chain around the country. We go there, we sit down, and here comes the server and the server\\u2019s real bubbly. \\u201cHey, guys. What\\u2019s going on? Are we celebrating anything today?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes, we are.\\u201d \\u201cWell, guess what? You\\u2019re not the only ones.\\u201d \\u201cYou see that couple over there?\\u201d \\u201cThat couple is celebrating 55 years of marriage today.\\u201d And we\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d So, we look. [whoosh]\\n[audience chuckles]\\nI said, \\u201cHow come they\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as server] \\u201cI wondered the same thing, but the man made it a point to say 55 years.\\u201d \\u201cI thought that was pretty impressive.\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, it is.\\u201d So he leaves to go get us some sodas and some bread. And I tell my manager, I said, \\u201cHey, Joe, listen.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019mma go say hi to the couple real quick.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t get us kicked out.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make it like last time.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s not gonna be.\\u201d So I get up, and I push in my chair, and I make my way over to the couple. Now, I understand how important this night is for them. I know exactly how long it took to get to that point, and I am not trying to mess that up. But I have questions. [audience chuckles] And these two people are clearly professionals in that department. So I approached the table as tactfully as I could. And I said, \\u201cPardon the interruption.\\u201d \\u201cIt has come to my attention that we are celebrating 55 years of marriage.\\u201d And the man was so happy that someone acknowledged that. He was just thrilled. He\\u2019s like\\u2026 [breathing excitedly] [as older man] \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, son.\\u201d \\u201cFifty-five years ago today, this lovely lady sittin\\u2019 next to me right here said I do, and we\\u2019ve been together ever since.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cThat is beautiful.\\u201d \\u201cMay I ask you a question?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cAbsolutely.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHow come you\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience chuckles] [laughs as older man] \\u201cHe wants to know how come we\\u2019re\\u2026 Laugh, goddammit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cSon, when you\\u2019ve been together as long as the two of us have, you might\\u2019ve seen a thing or two.\\u201d Uh, uh\\u2026 \\u201cWe have children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.\\u201d \\u201cWe have traveled this great big world of ours many times over.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re both retired military.\\u201d \\u201cWe have seen the best in people.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, unfortunately, when you\\u2019re around and alive as long as the two of us have been, uh, you\\u2019ve unfortunately seen the worst in people as well.\\u201d \\u201cWe have had just about every type of conversation there is to have. [audience chuckles] At least twice. [audience laughs] And after 55 years of marriage, well, hell, we\\u2019re just trying to enjoy each other\\u2019s company, even if it\\u2019s in silence.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve had every type of conversation there is to have?\\u201d And I guess I triggered him, because he was like, \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been in combat.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can faze me.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can surprise me anymore.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t say.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] So, I took a step towards them, I grab my shirt, and I flash them. [audience laughs] And then I walked away. And you know what happened next? They started talking! [audience laughs and cheers] I gave that couple the greatest gift they will never ever acknowledge. Something new, something spontaneous, something outrageous, something neither one of them had ever seen before. I gave them a new story. I promise you, every year moving forward, all they\\u2019re gonna talk about is what happened at 55. [as older man] \\u201cRemember, honey. Remember when that Samoan flashed us?\\u201d [audience laughs] Right. \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m a giver. I remember many, many years ago, before there was a venue like this to perform in, the only place around here for comedians to do shows was at a comedy club right outside these doors that was part of the original layout of the casino. [audience cheers] It was a club called The Improv. There\\u2019s a chain all over. [audience cheers] And, you know, many, many years ago, before all of this, that\\u2019s where Martin and myself, my buddy Alfred, we\\u2019d go do shows at the\\u2026 at the club. And the first time we got a chance to perform there, I didn\\u2019t really have a name. I wasn\\u2019t really established yet. And I want to take this moment to acknowledge and thank one person who was super, super helpful in that, a man by the name of DJ Laz.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s right, people. The Pimp with the Limp. Oh, yeah, Pap\\u00e1. Yeah. \\u201cIt\\u2019s your boy, DJ Laz.\\u201d I love him, man. He\\u2019s great. He\\u2019s awesome. But yeah, he walks in circles. He does. He walks in circles. Nice guy. DJ Laz was one of the first people to allow me to be on morning radio with him, and he helped promote my shows. Not only would he allow me to go on his show and promote my shows, he would come to my shows, and he would bring people, and he\\u2019d watch and he\\u2019d sit and hang out and laugh. The man has a million things he can do in Miami, but he\\u2019d come watch my show. And then the next day, \\u201cPap\\u00e1, come on the radio with me.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna talk about your show.\\u201d And he would help me sell out these shows year after year after year. So, Laz, I know you\\u2019re watching, Pap\\u00e1. Thank you. This is part of you, Pap\\u00e1. Muchas gracias. Thank you. Thank you. But that was many years down the line. In the beginning, the first time I performed at that comedy club, right outside these doors, that\\u2019s no longer there\\u2026 Um, I\\u2019m talking to the marketing person. Now, keep in mind, this is so long ago, there was no social media. There was no TikTok, no freaking Twitter, no Facebook, none of that. The only way you could promote yourself back then was, you had to get on morning radio, morning news, have somebody do a write-up on you in the newspaper. Remember those? Yeah. And then, of course, word-of-mouth, which is always the best. Uh, they had posters at the comedy club. And so, the marketing guy goes, \\u201cGabriel.\\u201d \\u201cHelp me help you help us.\\u201d \\u201cWe want to sell tickets. How do you want to be promoted?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWell\\u2026\\u201d Keep in mind, long time ago. I said, \\u201cUm, this is how I want you to promote my show.\\u201d \\u201cPlease use a photo.\\u201d \\u201cUnder the photo, put my name, Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t have the nickname Fluffy yet. That\\u2019s how long ago this was. I said, \\u201cUnderneath that, please put, \\u2018As seen on Comedy Central.'\\u201d Because at the time, that was the only television credit I had. So the marketing guy goes, \\u201cWell, I was thinking, what about, \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and his amigos\\u2019?\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201c\\u2018Amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWhy \\u2018amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cBecause I have other Mexicans with me?\\u201d And he looked at me and said, \\u201cGood. You get it.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like that. What about \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and friends\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWell, we want to put a couple of buzzwords out there to let the community know what type of show it is.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat type of show is it?\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cIt\\u2019s a special show.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel special.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cGabriel, hear me out. What about like a taco Tuesday?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cOkay, what about salsa night?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cSalsa night?\\u201d \\u201cWait, like dancing or chips and guac?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cEither one, I don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d I could not believe I was having this conversation, and I wanted to get upset. I wanted to go off on this guy for trying to make me feel like less of a person, right? But I didn\\u2019t, because I knew that if I went off on them, I would have been seen as difficult. I would have been seen as a problem, and I would not have been given another opportunity to come back. When people ask me, \\u201cWhat do you credit for your success?\\u201d Of course, talent, showing up, doing what you gotta do. But one word that gets left out a lot is the word \\u201csacrifice.\\u201d I had to sacrifice something that day, and a lot of people think they know what sacrifice means but honestly, until you have to make one, I don\\u2019t think you do. I had to sacrifice my pride because as much as I wanted to go off on this guy, I knew that if I did, I\\u2019d be shooting myself in the foot. I knew that if they could see what I could do on that stage, they\\u2019d have to bring me back, and they\\u2019d have to treat me different.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo as much as it hurt, as much as it sucked, I allowed that stupid taco Tuesday to happen. So, for me, I was very upset. I was wondering, is this something that happens to all new comedians, or was I being singled out? It was killing me. I needed to know. I couldn\\u2019t just take out my phone and google it because that wasn\\u2019t an option all those years back. So what I had to do was I had to go to the front door of the club where they had a bin, and the bin had flyers in it. So I grabbed the flyer, and I looked at it. And the flyer had the list of upcoming comedy shows. And I was so upset when I saw it because all it was, was pictures, names, and television credits. No silly names, no theme nights, no \\u201cspicy this\\u201d or \\u201ccrazy that.\\u201d Just comedy. So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this stupid taco Tuesday thing to me?\\u201d So I said, \\u201cLet me try to find another comedian who\\u2019s a little bit more in my vein.\\u201d If you know what I mean. The only other comedian I could find was a man by the name of George Lopez.\\n[audience cheers]\\nWith George\\u2019s promo, however, it was just a picture, name, and underneath that, a television credit that said, \\u201cAs seen on ABC.\\u201d That\\u2019s it. It didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cLikes to ride a donkey, George Lopez,\\u201d \\u201cEats a burrito with both hands, George Lopez.\\u201d \\u201cAy, ay, ay. I just jumped the wall. It\\u2019s George Lopez.\\u201d No! So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this to me?\\u201d So then I said, \\u201cAll right, all right.\\u201d \\u201cLet me see how they promote the Black comedians.\\u201d And with the Black comedians, it was the same thing. Picture, name, television credit, and that\\u2019s it. Unless it was a show that had multiple Black comedians on it because if the comedy club had a show with three or more Black comics on it, they would put a catchy name to it. They would call the show \\u201cUrban Night\\u201d or \\u201cApollo Night\\u201d or \\u201cDef Jam Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBET Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBlack-ish Comedy Night.\\u201d But that\\u2019s as far as they would go. They wouldn\\u2019t go to the next level like they would for me. Oh, yeah. There was no \\u201cMargarita Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTaco Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWetback Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTortilla Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFiesta Friday,\\u201d or \\u201cS\\u00e1bado Gigante\\u201d! No. That would never happen to Black people. Are you kidding me? You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMalt Liquor Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTupac Tuesday,\\u201d or \\u201cWatermelon Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cThong, Th-Thong, Thong Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFried Chicken Friday\\u201d or \\u201cSookie-Sookie Saturday\\u201d or \\u201cSlap-a-Ho Sunday\\u201d!\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nAnd that most definitely will not happen to white people. [audience chuckling] [scattered cheers] [speaks inaudibly] [cheering grows louder] Oh, I\\u2019mma do the joke. And you know why you can laugh and enjoy and not feel threatened by what I\\u2019m about to say? Because, like what I said earlier tonight, I am here to entertain, I am not here to offend. I\\u2019m here to have fun with everybody, starting with me. Plus, it\\u2019ll never happen. You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMonster Truck Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTrailer Park Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWhite Trash Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTake Your Sister Out Thursday.\\u201d [audience laughs] [in Southern accent] \\u201cOh, hell no, Fluffy! You done crossed the line now!\\u201d \\u201cMy name is Dustin, and I don\\u2019t play that shit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m from Davie, goddammit.\\u201d [audience cheers] Next time, stay quiet. [audience laughs] So\\u2026 I was talking to Martin backstage before I came out, and he goes, \\u201cAre you gonna share the story about the theme nights thing that happened at The Improv here, and y\\u2019know?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, y\\u2019know, I think I should, Martin.\\u201d \\u201cI think I should tell the story about, y\\u2019know, the theme nights.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cGabe, can I tell you something about that theme nights bit?\\u201d I go, \\u201cTell me, Martin.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cDo you realize that in all the years I have heard you tell this story about what happened at that club, do you understand that you\\u2019ve never once finished the week?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cMartin, you know why that is, right?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s the rule of comedy.\\u201d \\u201cYou always want to end on the biggest laugh.\\u201d \\u201cThursday gets the biggest laugh, which is why I stopped at Thursday.\\u201d And Martin goes, \\u201cI know, I know, I know.\\u201d \\u201cBut you\\u2019re robbing white people of their week.\\u201d [audience laughs] I never looked at it that way. \\u201cFox News Friday.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cStorm the Capitol Saturday.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cSay You\\u2019re Sorry Sunday\\u201d! [audience cheers] Are we still havin\\u2019 a good time? [audience cheers] Are we still having fun? [cheering grows louder] That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. People laughing, not getting upset, not getting offended, not freakin\\u2019 making a stink. And let me tell you right now, for the five people who have never heard of me before, this\\u2026 is for you. [scattered cheers] I get pulled over one night, two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-through. [audience cheering knowingly] I made a left turn instead of making a right turn, but I wasn\\u2019t paying attention, \\u2019cause I had a box, right? I was like, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d [chuckles enthusiastically] [exclaims, chuckles] \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d I make a wrong turn all of a sudden. [imitates siren] [groans] [imitates vehicle approaching] [grunts sadly] \\u201cLater.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[gibbers indistinctly] The officer is taking forever. I said, \\u201cForget this.\\u201d I grab the box of donuts. I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. I was like\\u2026 [inhales sharply] Mm! [chuckles] Ah! [exclaims wildly] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou know why I stopped you?\\u201d It was too easy. I picked up the box, and I said\\u2026 [with audience] \\u201c\\u2018Cause you can smell it!\\u201d [audience cheering] [crowd chanting] Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! [audience continues cheering] [chime dings] [Gabriel] You\\u2019re probably wondering, why did we pause the special again? Well, I just want to let you guys know most comedians would\\u2019ve already said, \\u201cThank you, good night,\\u201d gone home, cashed their Netflix checks, and hope they get another phone call. \\u201cPlease call me, Netflix.\\u201d [inhales] But this guy is not most comedians. That\\u2019s what happens when you hire a Mexican. We love overtime. [audience cheering] Thank you for still wanting to hear a joke that\\u2019s over 20 years old. [audience cheers] I grew up watching you too. [audience laughs] Got chills when I\\u2026 [in Spanish] Look, look. [audience laughs] [in English] That was beautiful. I love you too, and that\\u2026 Seriously, you guys, thank you for that. Thank you. [audience cheers] Thank you. There are fans, and then there\\u2019s what you just did right now. [audience cheering] I don\\u2019t know any other comedian that gets this type of love and loyalty. Thank you so much. I\\u2019m not getting off the stage yet \\u2019cause I still got more to go, but I want to say thank you for that. [audience cheers] Thank you. [sighs dramatically]\\n[audience cheering]\\n[Gabriel] Whoo! So when I started doing stand-up in 1997, the only place that would allow me to go up on stage and do what I do were bars. Dive bars, rough bars. Uh, Martin and I, that\\u2019s where we met, many, many years ago. We\\u2019re performing at this bar in Montebello, California, and, uh, you had to fight with the crowd. You had to fight because there was noise. There were TVs on. People were drinking, smoking\\u2026 People were doing everything in there but paying attention. So you had to come out quick, trying to get them to laugh. And one night, this comedian pulls me aside, and he goes, \\u201cHey, kid.\\u201d And when he called me kid, I got upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI could drink.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was 20, 21 years old, and, you know, even though I thought I was grown, I wasn\\u2019t. I wasn\\u2019t grown. Uh, I got upset that he pulled me aside. He goes, \\u201cCan I give you some advice?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWho does this guy think he is? I\\u2019m funnier than him.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I thought because at the age of 21, I was a punk. I really was. And so, I don\\u2019t know what got into me where I said, \\u201cSure, I\\u2019ll hear you out.\\u201d And I just stood there, and he said, \\u201cListen.\\u201d \\u201cUm, you\\u2019re really likeable on stage, and that\\u2019s rare.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna give you a bit of advice.\\u201d \\u201cIf you cut all the cussing out of your show and start taking the filthy material out, I think you\\u2019re gonna have a long career ahead of you.\\u201d And I know I said \\u201ctake the cussing out\\u201d and I\\u2026 I said the F-word twice tonight. [audience chuckles] Technically, no, three times. I said it three times. Um, but I\\u2019m mindful of it. I\\u2019m keeping count. It\\u2019s not every other word. Plus, we\\u2019re in a casino. [audience cheers] Okay. No one loses their ass and says, \\u201cAw, shucks.\\u201d No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI heard some of you cussing before. \\u201cWhen the fuck is this gonna start?\\u201d Yeah, I heard you. I heard you. [in Spanish] I\\u2019m fat, not deaf. [in English] I heard you, goddammit. So anyway, he gives me this advice. Cut the cussing out of your show, take out the filthy material. And I don\\u2019t know why I listen, but I did, and he was absolutely right. All of a sudden, I started getting opportunities left and right. I started getting booked at colleges, high schools, churches, fairs. And then the big one, casinos. [audience cheers] [cheering fades] Back in the day, you had to be squeaky-clean to perform at a casino. Uh, but that\\u2019s not the case anymore. If you can sell tickets, it doesn\\u2019t matter what you do, they want to book you. But back in the day, there was only a few people who could pull it off. I was fortunate to be one of those people. So I remember, I got booked to perform at a casino called Morongo in Southern California, and I\\u2019m backstage with the booker, the lady that hired me for the function, and she goes, \\u201cSo, no cussing, right?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. No cussing.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cNo filthy material?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNo filthy material.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cGood luck.\\u201d And it was just me. I didn\\u2019t have openers. It was just me. It was a voice-over on the frickin\\u2019 speaker, right? \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome comedian, funny man Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d And then I just\\u2026 I walked out there, right? I offended the entire audience\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026in five seconds. And I did it without cussing. Frickin\\u2019 22-year-old kid goes up on stage, looks at the crowd and says, \\u201cHey, everybody! Is this a regular casino, or is this an Indian casino?\\u201d [audience groans and laughs] You see how you all know?\\n[audience laughs]\\nI didn\\u2019t know. I didn\\u2019t know because I didn\\u2019t have TikTok to teach me. [audience chuckles] What I did have was a life experience that I\\u2019ll never forget. As soon as I said that, the entire front row, which comprised of the tribal members from the casino, they all stood up, and one of them called me out in front of the entire audience. \\u201cHey! Hey! You don\\u2019t say that anymore!\\u201d \\u201cThe proper term is Native American.\\u201d \\u201cPlease show respect.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh my God. I\\u2019m so sorry. I didn\\u2019t know.\\u201d And I felt horrible, and I was so embarrassed. Fortunately, I had a second show at ten o\\u2019clock. Ten o\\u2019clock hits. I take the stage. I didn\\u2019t need to be told a thousand times that I messed up. That one time of me getting shamed in front of the entire audience was all I needed. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m a firm believer in shaming. [audience laughs] I think shaming is good. Shaming is good as long as you shame with purpose. If you\\u2019re about to teach someone a valuable lesson, I say go for it because it worked for me. I got shamed one time. Second show, ten o\\u2019clock. I took the stage. Ooh, it was different. I was like, \\u201cBefore I get started, ladies and gentlemen, I\\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Native Americans who are here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cThank you for this opportunity to perform in your casino.\\u201d \\u201cI hope you enjoy the performance.\\u201d [audience cheers and laughs] I thought I was good. All of a sudden, another tribal member in the back jumped up. And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey, drop the \\u2018American\\u2019! Just say \\u2018Native\\u2019!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201c\\u2018Kay!\\u201d [audience laughs] That stayed with me. That was powerful. That was scary. Next time I did a casino, first thing I said was, \\u201cI would like to acknowledge all of the Natives who are here tonight,\\u201d and then someone yelled out, \\u201cWe\\u2019re Indigenous!\\u201d Fuck me! That\\u2019s four. [audience laughs and cheers] [chime dings] With time, I got a chance to perform all across the United States, and then I get my first-ever show in Canada. Ironically enough, at a casino. [audience laughs] It\\u2019s a casino we still perform at called Caesars in the city of Windsor, Ontario, right across the water from Detroit, Michigan. [audience cheers] I come to find out the hard way that in Canada, it is a completely different term for describing the\\u2026 people\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026originally from that land. The proper term in Canada is actually \\u201cFirst Nation.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t know that. I was so nervous being in Canada, I said, \\u201cNative American.\\u201d [audience laughs] Like, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I\\u2019m not even in America, right? Frickin\\u2019 stupid, right? Pendejo, I know. [audience laughs] Fortunately, someone pulled me to the side, and they told me what was up. I was lucky that I had a second show. Ten o\\u2019clock, I take the stage, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBefore I begin, I would like to acknowledge all of the First Nation people who are here tonight.\\u201d Then some guy yells out, \\u201cCall us Indians!\\u201d [audience laughs] This guy in the front row was like\\u2026 [in Indian accent] \\u201cThey\\u2019re not Indian.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[in Indian accent] \\u201cThey are not Indian!\\u201d [as self] Canada has always been an adventure. There was one show that we did at the same casino. Anytime now, we perform outside of the United States, even if it\\u2019s next door in Canada or Mexico, Martin\\u2019s first question to the audience is, \\u201cDo we have any Americans in the house tonight?\\u201d Because no matter where we perform in the world, there\\u2019s always a handful. So that night, Martin takes the stage, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans here tonight?\\u201d Not knowing that earlier in the day, at that same casino, in the grand ballroom, there was a\\u2026 a end-of-year holiday party from an American company from right across the water in Detroit. And they were having this end-of-year celebration, and they were there, pre-gaming since noon. [audience chuckles] Partying it up. And I guess the\\u2026 the party planner for the event thought it would be an amazing idea to end their party with laughter. So this person bought all of the tickets to my show that night and gave them to that company. Well, seven o\\u2019clock rolls around, and everybody stumbles in, takes their seats, and then Martin walks out, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans?\\u201d And instead of getting a \\u201cYay,\\u201d \\u201cWhoo,\\u201d \\u201cRight here,\\u201d he got\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] They were so drunk, they started chanting. \\u201cUSA! USA! USA! USA!\\u201d I\\u2019m in the dressing room, hearing this. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are we here?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cWe could have done this in Detroit.\\u201d You know? I had to fill out paperwork. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis is not cool.\\u201d So during intermission, Martin comes backstage and he tells me, \\u201cBro, I don\\u2019t know if you heard\\u2026\\u201d [as self] \\u201cOh, I heard.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cMight wanna mention it.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOh, I will.\\u201d So at some point during my performance, I told the audience, \\u201cSo, a little bird told me there might be a couple of Americans here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cIs that true?\\u201d Sure enough\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] And they started doing it again. [chanting] \\u201cUSA! USA! USA!\\u201d Then it got quiet, and you could hear, \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, do you understand what just happened?\\u201d \\u201cWe just made history.\\u201d And people in the front row, they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about, history?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWe just made history.\\u201d \\u201cWho would have ever thought you\\u2019d see the day where thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of Americans would cross a border\\u2026\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\u2026to see a Mexican?\\u201d\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you for 27 years of supporting this Mexican.\\n[in Spanish] Miami, I love you so much.

Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\\u2013 There\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all.\\n\\u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\\u201d\\nI live\\u2013 I live in New York. I always\\u2013 Like, there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\\u2019s always walking her dog. She\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\\u2013 The two of them, it\\u2019s really\\u2013 The dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\\u2013 And she\\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\\u201910\\u201d, But now it\\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \\u201cyecch, no thank you. \\u201cI do not want those. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \\u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\\u2019s no\\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \\u201cgood morning, gladys,\\u201d She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cgood,\\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \\u201c\\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n\\u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\\u201d\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\\u2019s a weird moment, too, \\u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \\u201cyeah, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \\u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \\u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \\u201cwhy did he die, da\\u2013\\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\\u2019s the reason. That\\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead. He didn\\u2019t know his name, and he didn\\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\\u2019t know which one. I don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\\u2019t. They don\\u2019t care, and we don\\u2019t care. There\\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \\u201cok, everybody. \\u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\\u2013you know what?\\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\\u201d And we would all be like, \\u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\\u201d Anyway, so we\\u2019re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\\u2019s going\\u2013 They\\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \\u201cbaa,\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\\u2019re like\\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 They go\\u2013 My daughter\\u2019s like, \\u201cwhat is he saying?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know! \\u201cI\\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\\u201d\\n\\u201cThe Food Chain\\u201d\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\\u2019re in the food chain. You\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\\u2019s how all life ends, is\\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \\u201cI love you. Bye.\\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \\u201cbeh,\\u201d and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cfine,\\u201d And it\\u2019s just, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\\u2019t get it! Then you\\u2019re walking to work like, \\u201cwhy do I even bother? \\u201cshit! Goddamn it! \\u201cthere\\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\\u201d You think that sharks\\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\\u2019d be bummed \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \\u201chey, nobody has any idea what\\u2019s down here,\\u201d And we\\u2019re all up here like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s totally a shark right there.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\\u2013 \\u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\\u2019s why animals just\\u2013 They go, \\u201clet\\u2019s do this together, man. \\u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\\u201d That\\u2019s why they do it like that. \\u201cfuck it. I\\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cgrownups ain\\u2019t worth the meat.\\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n\\u201cCourtyard Confrontation\\u201d\\nI live in New York city, and it\\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\\u2019m not used to it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\\u2019t get a fountain made without\\u2013 \\u201ccan you make me a fountain?\\u201d \\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll get started right away! \\u201cYes! Yes! It\\u2019s finished!\\u201d And it\\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \\u201cjust piss on me forever!\\u201d Anyway, there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\\u2026 And so I\\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\\u2019s looking at me like, \\u201c\\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \\u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \\u201c\\u201d And then I see him go, \\u201cno. That\\u2019s not gonna do at all,\\u201d And he comes over to me, \\u201c\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNum num num!\\u201d I\\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \\u201crrgh!\\u201d So he comes over, says, \\u201cexcuse me, \\u201cdo you live in this building?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there? I said, \\u201cno.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI just need to rest. I\\u2019m having a hard time.\\u201d He says, \\u201cthis is private property,\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, I don\\u2019t really believe in that.\\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t leave, I\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\\u201d I was like, \\u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\\u201d So he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno,\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \\u201cno. That guy lives here. It\\u2019s OK,\\u201d And the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\\u2013 It was just so\\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings. That\\u2019s how excited I was.\\n\\u201cGetting What \\u2018Old\\u2019 Is\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m 45 now, So I\\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\\u2019t know which one. I won\\u2019t know till it\\u2019s over where this was. I don\\u2019t know how long I\\u2019m gonna live. I don\\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad.\\u201d If I die five years from now, they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cwell, all right,\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 It\\u2019s\\u2013 Like, as soon as you\\u2019re 50, you\\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\\u2019re in the news, and it\\u2019s always some old guy, \\u201cI met Napoleon.\\u201d No, you didn\\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwow, this seems early for this.\\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\\u2019ll realize, \\u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\\u2019s just like, \\u201cJust\\u2013 \\u201d My asshole\\u2013 My asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \\u201crats.\\u201d That\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\\u2019m\\u2013 OK. Say I\\u2019m sitting down. If I\\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\\u2013ha ha ha!\\u2013 I love sitting so much\\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\\u2013 At my age, if I\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \\u201cwhat? Why do I\\u2013 no. Why, though?\\u201d \\u201cYour car is being towed right now!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\\u2019s\\u2013 I accept that.\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \\u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\\u201d Like, let\\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \\u201c\\u201d like I\\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \\u201cshit.\\u201d\\n\\u201cPutting On Socks\\u201d\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\\u2013 Here\\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\\u2019t even know how I do it. I\\u2019m sitting here. I don\\u2019t know how I do that. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 It\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\\u2013 I\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \\u201cbeep, beep, beep!\\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \\u201cOK. That\\u2019s hard.\\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n\\u201cIf You\\u2019re Older You\\u2019re Smarter\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right. It means that even if they\\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\\u2019ve been there longer. If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\\u2019s the interesting thing. There\\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\\u2019t clap. Why? \\u2019cause they\\u2019re smart. They\\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to clap. I don\\u2019t have to do anything.\\u201d They\\u2019re not doing it, and they\\u2019re right. You know why? \\u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m asking. How do you know what\\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\\u2019s every time. \\u201cWhoo! Whoo!\\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\\u2019re not the only people here. That\\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\\u2013 \\u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\\u2019t have it! I don\\u2019t have it!\\u201d If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \\u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\\u2019s seen more. He\\u2019s seen history. He\\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \\u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \\u201cthe president\\u2019s kind of disappointing.\\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n\\u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\\u201d\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \\u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \\u201chey, I\\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\\u201d \\u201cso where do I\\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\\u2019d like to make one of those \\u201cit gets better\\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \\u201clisten, man. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s tough right now. \\u201cYou\\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \\u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \\u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \\u201cbut it gets better because you\\u2019ll all grow up, \\u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \\u201cand they don\\u2019t. \\u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \\u201cand you\\u2019re gonna be there. \\u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \\u201cbefore she hits the ground. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna be so great. \\u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \\u201cto match your looks, but it\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cWhen real shit matters, you\\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\\u201d It\\u2019s just time. That\\u2019s all it takes. There\\u2019s a formula to this. It\\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n\\u201cEverybody Has Their Time\\u201d\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone.\\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\\u2019s all that happens, \\u201caww,\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \\u201cAww.\\u201d Well, go fuck one. \\u201cNah.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t think so. That\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \\u201cyeah. No. You should. I\\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\\u201d\\n\\u201cDating Takes Courage\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\\u2013 It\\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\\u2019t do this!\\u201d But he walked up and said, \\u201chi. Yes,\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\\u201d Sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\\u2019s the whole thing. That\\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \\u201cdude, I can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\\u201d But women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah. I\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\\u201d What are you, nuts? \\u201cI\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\\u201d \\u201cTo your death, statistically.\\u201d How do they still do it? If you\\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI hope this one\\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFirst Date\\u201d\\nI always\\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together And she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha! \\u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\\u2026\\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cthat was good. He\\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\\u201d And he has no idea. He\\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there.\\n\\u201cTits\\u201d\\nGuys are\\u2013 We love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 And we just look at you. That\\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Like they\\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \\u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\\u201d And 100% of us will go, \\u201cyes, of course.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \\u201cyeah. Ok.\\u201d Beep! \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019s not your tits. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 You don\\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit. \\u201cthank you, Deborah. I\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\\u201d It\\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d Which I don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d But that\\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d There\\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that!\\u201d \\u201cthe end.\\u201d \\u201cmy god! \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\\u2013 And you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \\u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\\u201d That\\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\\u2019s, once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\\u2019t get the second one. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit.\\u201d \\u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \\u201cI like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\\u201d And if it\\u2019s up to the guy, we\\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \\u201cyou know what? \\u201cI\\u2019m good with the one. That\\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\\u201d We\\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 \\u201cyeah\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cthere\\u2019s a bomb!\\u201d \\u201cshit! Come on, let\\u2019s get\\u2013 \\u201ccome on! Let\\u2019s get your tits out of here!\\u201d\\n\\u201cDivorce\\u201d\\nI\\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\\u2019ve seen\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 48 maybe. I don\\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\\u2019m not saying don\\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\\u2019s the best part. It\\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \\u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\\u2019s over. I can\\u2019t take it.\\u201d And again, if you\\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\\u2019s just a fact. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s true. Everything\\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\\u2019m a good father. I\\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \\u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\\u2019s like every parent\\u2019s fantasy. Who can\\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \\u201cgood-bye, girls. \\u201cDaddy\\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m such a good dad.\\n\\u201cVideoing Your Kids\\u201d\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\\u2019s there, and everybody\\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \\u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 There\\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \\u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \\u201cmy god! \\u201cit\\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\\u201d And guess what? They\\u2019re not watching it, either. They\\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \\u201cthat\\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\\u201d Nobody\\u2019s watching your kids\\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\\u201d\\n\\u201cLife Is A Good Deal\\u201d\\nDon\\u2019t tape shit on your\\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 Here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything, You just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Every time I\\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \\u201cI could die right now,\\u201d and I mean it! That\\u2019s how good life is. You get to\\u2013 you get to fuck. That\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\\u2019s your buddy. If you\\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\\u2019m not worried about it ending.\\n\\u201cBehind The Wheel\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty good, and I\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\\u2019t know. You know, it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\\u2019re driving, That\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \\u201cworthless piece of shit.\\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \\u201cWorthless piece of shit\\u201d? That\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son. And things I\\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 I don\\u2019t remember, even\\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d? \\u201cworthless piece of shit!\\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d I said that to a person. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d Why? \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\\u2019d like to think that I\\u2019m a nice person, But I don\\u2019t know, man.\\n\\u201cIf Murder Was Legal\\u201d\\nA lot of it is context. There\\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019d love to think, \\u201cI would never do that,\\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause, Like, \\u201cI would never do that.\\u201d No. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\\u2019t like them. \\u201cI never killed anybody.\\u201d \\u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \\u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\\u201d \\u201cI think he\\u2019s nice.\\u201d \\u201cshut up, Janet.\\u201d They would just\\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\\u2019d go to a mall, there\\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\\u2019t listen to me!\\u201d Just\\u2013pbbt! There\\u2019d be just\\u2013 You\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross. \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment. \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of America. \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n\\u201cOf Course, But Maybe\\u201d\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\\u2013 That\\u2019s the thing I believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing, and I don\\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \\u201cof course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \\u201chow did they build those pyramids?\\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\\u2019re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me! I have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists. The last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator\",\n",
              "  'that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!” My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be',\n",
              "  'racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up!',\n",
              "  'Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo',\n",
              "  \"to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.” My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal\",\n",
              "  'eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!” ♪ A whole new world ♪ It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.” I’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and',\n",
              "  'unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember',\n",
              "  \"when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!” I don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?”\",\n",
              "  'And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.” I can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there.',\n",
              "  'But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy. You know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin. So, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad\",\n",
              "  \"jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits… Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot. Yeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a\",\n",
              "  'joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to',\n",
              "  'be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah. My dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR. As a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father. I mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad. When I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.” I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. – What’s your name?',\n",
              "  '– Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend. I’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it. Everyone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable. I had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny. I think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out',\n",
              "  'dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.” My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need',\n",
              "  'you to send me some money like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.” Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that…',\n",
              "  'the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?” No. This is who I’m making fun of when I make',\n",
              "  \"a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like,\",\n",
              "  '“Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.” This might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better.

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even\",\n",
              "  'open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming',\n",
              "  'out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what',\n",
              "  'it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s',\n",
              "  'up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have',\n",
              "  'a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So',\n",
              "  'that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!”',\n",
              "  'Air traffic control: “I don’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear',\n",
              "  'something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shaking. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little',\n",
              "  'angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

Yawn Reply Renée 24/03/2025 at 20:32 Bill Burr is a comedic genius! He has the courage to make people laugh at some very serious issues in life, by identifying that the issues can be perceived in a different context, one that is much more realistic than people would think. His parody of Catholicism and Christianity, and how God and Jesus might actually be thinking or feeling helped me truly lighten up and ended up changing my reactions, behavior and feelings about being judged and judging others and myself. Anyway, any deed that results in people feeling more understanding and tolerant and less judgmental is a BLESSING. Don’t let yourself get caught up in a stereotype when perceiving something as you believe others expect you to do. The truth shall set you free. ~ Joy ~ Reply Leave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *Type here..

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen. I don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!” This went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare. That would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that. I’ve been hanging out in– I',\n",
              "  'haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones. It doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots. Everybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off. I’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in',\n",
              "  'my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell. It’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear. A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear. Uh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited. I knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars. And then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you',\n",
              "  'would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…” And then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.” He was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them. I know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out. The second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that. Some people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was',\n",
              "  'a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect. We’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was. But if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated. And then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off. If Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit. You know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in. Somebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife’s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.” They’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, “Man, I miss Bruce.” I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it.',\n",
              "  'He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see people. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening? Wait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, “How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?” If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.” The third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of Chappelle’s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.“ And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.” Well, you young heads missed that shit. You’re all too young. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike. I remember',\n",
              "  'I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us. My point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way. I used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest. However, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, “When did everyone get mad?” And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.” And then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front',\n",
              "  'of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too. The ’70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on… Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure. Yeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer!” I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works. Can’t do comparative suffering. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian. Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough. You guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I',\n",
              "  'knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a? Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true. “♪ Got everything, I got everything ♪ ♪ I cannot complain, I cannot ♪ ♪ I don’t even know How much I really made ♪ ♪ I forgot, it’s a lot ♪ ♪ Fuck that, never mind what I got ♪” And his wife will be like, “Kevin, come to bed!” He’ll be like… “♪ Ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ I got way too much– ♪” You know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have “Quiet, please” money at best. I’d have to take a loan out for “Shut the fuck up.” “Shut the fuck up–” That’s Jay Z money. And Beyoncé got “No, you shut the fuck up” money. Let’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just',\n",
              "  'the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much!

This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that.

[cheering stops] [Gabriel] Man, look at this crowd. They are going crazy for this guy. Who is he? Why are they losing their minds? Well, I guess we’re just gonna have to go back to the beginning and figure it out. Editor, please do me a favor and take us back to the beginning. [tape rewinds] [Gabriel] Uh, you know what?

That’s… a lot… Uh, you went… All right. Real funny, editor. Real funny. When I said go back to the beginning, this isn’t what I meant. But seriously, how long is this special? [chime dings] [Gabriel] Oh. Okay, well, we’ll rewind it just that amount, and let’s give these people somethin’ to talk about.

Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! We’re in Miami, bitch! [loud cheering] Yeah. Freaking Miami. This is the only place I could pull this off. [crowd laughs] I can’t wear this in LA. They’re like, [in Spanish] “I’m blind!” [in English] “It’s too much.” Ah, freaking Mexican DJ Khaled up here. I know, right? Also, I would like to thank, since we’re here, Only in Dade. Thank you so much. If you know, you know… [audience cheers] …and I think you know. [crowd chuckles] And also, to my friends over at La Carreta for all the food. So… [crowd cheers] Yes. [laughing] Yeah, man. Before we get started, you guys, uh, I would like to thank the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino for the opportunity to record a special. No other entertainer has done a special here yet. Tonight is the first one. [crowd cheering] It wasn’t the Rolling Stones. It wasn’t the Eagles. They trusted a comedian… [crowd cheers] …to make this happen. So I wanna say thank you. Is anybody else staying here at the, uh… at the Hard Rock? [crowd cheers] Hey, me too. [audience laughs] This is a beautiful hotel, and I’m not just saying that ’cause my room is free. [audience laughs] You know you’re in a nice hotel and casino when you turn on your TV in your room and they have their own video. Like, if you’re staying here, you turn on the TV, you get this, [trills tongue] [feminine voice] “Welcome to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.” [audience chuckles] [moans seductively] “Twenty-four-hour gambling, seven days a week, 365 days a year.” [moans suggestively] I’m sitting there like, “Why can’t I stop watching this?” And I started thinking, at this point, why don’t they just do that to the slot machines? You know? Gambling’s already shameless. Might as well go all the way. You walk up to one of the little machines, pop in a 20. [whirring] [moans loudly] [whirring, moans] [feminine voice] “Don’t stop.” [as self] “I’m not gonna.” [audience laughs] People are walking by. “What are you doing?” [as self] “Trying to get the jackpot!” [audience laughs] Yeah, man. I’m gonna start the show off tonight with a question. That’s not how comedy shows happen, but I’m gonna start it with a question. The question is, who here tonight has never heard of me up until tonight? [scattered cheering] Five. Two. Five. Okay. To those of you, the five of you, I say, “Sorry.” I know you got excited. You saw the ticket. You saw the last name, and then I walked out. And you’re like, “Enrique got bigger.” [audience laughs] The only reason why I ask who has never seen or heard of me before is because if you have, then you know the type of show that I do. And you know the type of show that I don’t do. Like, I’m not here to tell you who to vote for, who not to vote for, what shot to take or what baby to get rid of. That’s not for me to say. If you’re already offended, you missed the point. I’m telling you what I’m not gonna do. I promise you, I am here to entertain, not offend. Okay? [audience cheers] We’re gonna have fun with everybody. Starting with me, but I’m gonna let you know, we’re living in a different time. I’ve been doing this so long, I always figured, as long as I’m being nice, I shouldn’t have any issues, but it’s a very different time. This is year 27 for me. [crowd cheers] Yeah. Twenty-seven years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I never had to worry. You know, when I first got started, shoot… 1997, I was clean-shaven, I had hair. I know. Look at some of you. “What happened?” Huh? Vaccine. I know. I’m kidding. I’m kid… I’m kidding. Sorry, Florida. I’m kidding. I’m kidding. I said “Vaccine,” some of you were like, “I told you!” Yeah. [crowd laughs] [in Spanish] “I told you. He said so.” [audience chuckles] [in English] Some friends tell me, “Dude, man, you’re making money now. Why don’t you get the hair thingy?” I said, “For what?” “Well, you know, some women, they want a guy with hair.” Well, good for them. [audience laughs] And they’re not lying. I have gone out with some women that made it a point to tell me that hair was important. One told me flat out, “I need to be able to run my fingers through your hair.” Yeah! And I told her, “Hey, look, if you go deep enough… [audience laughs] …you’re gonna get your wish.” “You were not specific on location. Hey.” “You want hair, you want pelos, I got you.” But, yeah, 27 years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I have seen a lot of comedians come and go. And I feel very grateful that in all that time, we’ve still managed to maintain a certain level. [audience cheers] So I feel like we’re doing something right. Which feels weird to me, because now',\n",
              "  \"I feel like you gotta be very mindful. Okay? You gotta be extra mindful. Like… Uh, 27 years of being a comedian, I finally started hearing people tell me things that I’ve never heard before. I started hearing people tell me things like, “Hey, Fluffy. I grew up watching you.” [audience chuckles] Which is an incredible compliment because that doesn’t just say that you’re a fan, that says that you’re invested. That says that you’ve been following this career for a very long time. Some of you, the first time you saw me perform, you were kids. [audience cheers] And now some of you are here tonight with your kids. [audience cheers] And so, I just want to say thank you for all those years of trust and continuing to come back to see the show. It means a lot. [audience cheers and applauds] Hearing someone say they grew up watching me, that is one of the most beautiful compliments any entertainer can receive. And I understand that now, with therapy, that that’s what that means. [audience chuckles] Look, I’m not gonna lie. The first time I heard someone tell me that they grew up watching me, I didn’t know how to handle it. I didn’t know how to process because nobody wants to feel like they’re getting… old. The first time I heard it, I was like… [gasps dramatically] Second time I heard it, I was like, “Buy a hat.” The third time, I accepted it. I was like, [as old white man’] “Many years ago, when I first got started, all of this was land as far as the eye could see.” “It was a very different time, and…” By the way, I don’t know why my old voice is white. [audience laughs] He just is. I tried doing the Mexican voice, but you don’t take him as serious. [in Spanish] “Well, screw you.” “We were at the ranch, and were told to fuck off, dude.” “It’s very tough out there.” [in English] But times are changing. The rules are changing. So I don’t know how much longer this is gonna be okay. I’ll tell you what happened to me and why I brought that up. I did a podcast. And before I went into the studio, I’m talking to the producer outside. And the producer’s excited and happy, and she’s like, “Gabriel Iglesias, we’re so excited to have you.” “This is really cool.” “Before you go in, the host wanted me to ask you something before you go in for your interview.” I go, “Sure, go for it.” “Okay. What do you identify as?” [audience chuckles] I wasn’t sure how to answer that. I’m 47 years old. I didn’t know what to say. I was like, “Shit. Hungry, I guess.” I mean… [audience laughs] I’m tired, sleepy, depressed on Tuesdays. I don’t know what you want me to say. See, here’s the thing. I knew what she was trying to ask me. I just wasn’t trying to get involved in a conversation about something that has absolutely nothing to do with me. This was… Yeah. [audience cheers] I felt like I was being baited because no matter how I answered that question, I was gonna find myself in an awkward situation. So you know, because for me, I was just like, “Let me just be funny.” But nowadays, you can’t just not answer the question because silence is seen as a problem. And I’m sorry if me not answering a certain question is considered a problem. I was brought up during a time where you were constantly told to mind your business. [audience cheers] That’s all I’m trying to do is stay in my lane. Another thing we were constantly told was always respect your elders. [audience cheers] And no matter what generation you were from, that was at least the one thing we could always agree on until now. Now older people are seen as a problem. They are. You know, and I understand the youth of today has the technology in the palm of their hands, and you can google just about anything, but you cannot google life experience. Okay? You can’t. You can’t download struggling. You can’t download failure. You can’t download these moments that help build you up to make you a better person. And so again, for me, I chose to stay in my lane and just crack jokes when the girl asked me the question. She got very upset. She got very offended. As soon as I cracked the joke, she was like, “No, that’s not what I mean.” “I mean what are your pronouns?” “What?” “What are your pronouns?” “For example, are you a they or them?” “A they”? [audience chuckles] “Or a them”? [audience laughs] “How fat am I?” [audience laughs] “When did I stop being an it?” Apparently, I ate myself into a plural. That’s what happened. [audience chuckles and applauds] What I’m finding is, even if you have good intentions, and you’re trying to be cool, you can still find yourself in a situation. So, I’ll tell you what else happened to me, m’kay? I was at a McDonald’s. [audience chuckles] That’s not even the joke, but okay. [audience laughs] All righty. They’re like, “Here, this is gonna be good.” No, no! I was at a McDonald’s by my house. The McDonald’s by my house is actually a twofer. It’s a McDonald’s on the corner, and it’s also a gas station. I got a big SUV. I knew it was gonna be a minute. So I said, “Let me go get some nuggets while I’m here.” I walk into the McDonald’s, and as I’m walking in, I couldn’t help but notice this homeless family sitting right outside. Now, they didn’t have a sign. They did not ask me for money, but you could just tell. You could just tell that this poor family is dealing with life. So I get inside, and I said, “You know what?” “I don’t need anything to eat.” “I really don’t. At this point, it’s just the habit.” [audience laughs] I get to the register, and I say, “You know what? Let me order some food for the family.” “They got kids with them.” So I placed an order and the cashier’s like, “Anything else?” “Actually, yes. Do you have, um… um, Wet-Naps?” “Excuse me?” “You know, Wet-Naps to clean your hands.” “Sir, you’re more than welcome to use the restroom.” “I’ll give you the code.” “Here’s the thing.” “It’s not for me. It’s for the homeless family that’s right outside the door.” “I want to make sure that the little kids can clean their hands before they eat.” “This food that I just ordered is for them.” And as we’re talking… [audience cheers] Thank you. As we’re talking, the manager at the McDonald’s is listening in to our conversation. And she walks over. And she’s all nosy, right? She’s like, “Excuse me. I couldn’t help but overhear.” “Did you just say that this food is for the family outside?” [as self] “Yeah. I hope that’s okay.” [as manager] “No, it is definitely okay.” “Giving food to people who need food is definitely okay.” “However, what you just called them is not okay.” [audience groans] [as self] “What did I call them?” [as manager] “You said… homeless.” [as self] “‘Cause they are! Look. Shit.” [audience laughs] “He’s lickin’ the window!” [audience laughs] [as manager] “You can’t say that word. It’s considered offensive.” [as self] “Who complained?” “Okay, well, if I’m not supposed to say the word ‘homeless’ anymore, what am I supposed to say instead of the word ‘homeless’?” [as manager] “The new politically correct term is actually ‘unhoused’ when describing someone in an unfortunate situation like that.” [audience jeering] [as self] “You’re kidding.” [as manager] “No, sir. I’m not kidding. And please lower your voice.” [as self] “You want me to lower my voice when you’re saying something so ridiculous?” [as manager] “If you think it’s ridiculous, then clearly, you are part of the problem, not the solution.” [audience chuckling] Oh, Miami. I wanted to get ghetto. [audience cheers] I wanted to get ghetto. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I wanted to go full Hialeah on them. [audience cheering] [man] Love you, Fluffy! Thank you for coming, Hialeah. [audience cheers] So yeah, I wanted to go off on her, but I… I… I wanted to get ghetto, but I couldn’t because that is the regular McDonald’s I go to. [audience chuckles] You know what I’m saying? I’m not trying to get banned. The next one’s far, and gas is a bitch, so I’m like, “Nah.” So I looked at her, and I said, “Okay. We’re gonna play this game?” “Let’s play this game.” “From now on, I’m no longer fat.” [audience chuckles] “According to you, I am now ‘unexercised.'” [audience\",\n",
              "  'laughs] [audience cheering] I did, bro. She looked at me, and she’s like, “Don’t be ridiculous.” And I looked at her, and I was like, “Oh!” “Oh, well, if you think it’s ridiculous, then clearly you are part of the problem.” “Not the solution.” [audience cheers] And I grabbed the food, and I walked out. Now, second half of the story. I walk over to the family. M’kay? And I hand the bags of food to the mom. And the mom was so nice. She was just happy that someone thought of her and her kids. She got very emotional. She’s like, “I just want to say thank you.” “You have no idea what you’re doing for us right now.” “This really means a lot.” “Thank you.” And I had to ask the question. [audience chuckles] I said, “Are you okay?” I know what you thought. Some of you are like, “Don’t do it.” Oh, I did it. That’s why we’re here. Watch. So, I looked, and I said, “Are you okay?” And she was like, “No, unfortunately. We’re not okay. We’re not.” “We’ve been homeless now for four days.” And I was like, “Um…” [audience laughs] “I don’t know if you heard.” [audience laughs] “But, uh…” No, not… I didn’t correct her. [audience chuckles] I didn’t correct her ’cause I’m not a dick. That’s why I didn’t correct her. [audience laughs] That’s what I mean, you guys. Even if you have good intentions nowadays, people can take what you’re saying or doing and twist it to make you look bad. There should be no consequences for being kind, for trying to help, for wanting to do the right thing, for caring. Unfortunately, we’re still consumed by this word called “liability” that sometimes we forget to be a little human, and that’s unfortunate. I’m not trying to get on a soapbox about this. I’m trying to let you know some things I’ve been dealing with, and I’m just here to report. [audience chuckles] The thing with me now is that after 27 years of being a comedian, every time I walk out the door, the light is officially on. In the sense that every time I leave my house, there is a slight chance I could make the news. For example, did Martin talk about how, uh, he fell off the stage earlier in the show? [crowd] Yeah. Okay. Okay, cool. Uh, for the home audience, Martin, he fell a while back. He talked about it. I know you didn’t see it, ’cause your subscription only covers so much. Um, yeah. [audience laughs] You can watch the first half on Prime. I think it’s on Prime. Maybe you can just see it there then come back and check out the rest. So, long story short, we were doing a show in Phoenix, Arizona, and Martin accidentally fell off of a stage this high, and he broke his foot. Now, the incredible part about Martin is that he got up, and on adrenaline, ran around, got back up on stage, and performed. And then was taken to the hospital after he walked off stage. He is a professional. [audience cheers] Seriously, that is a pro. Much respect ’cause if it would have been me… [audience chuckles] If I would’ve fallen off stage, and the staff was like, “What about the fans?” “Well, bye, Felicia.” [audience laughs] “What do we tell ’em?” “Refund.” [audience laughs] But see, the difference is Martin had to tell you he fell for you to know he fell. And by the way, I saw the fall. I saw. He came out and just kind of tripped over a cord backstage, came through the curtain already, you know. And then, you know… “Martiiin!” [imitates thud] Women in the front row were like, “He fell for me.” [audience laughs] I’m glad you laughed. I said that last night and some guy was like, “Aw.” [audience chuckles] I said, “Why ‘aww’?” [as man] “Well, that’s your friend.” [as self] “Exactly. That’s why I make fun of him.” That is the mark of a true friendship, is being able to say real evil things about each other. [audience cheers] Because you know you don’t really mean it. Plus, you don’t think that if I would’ve fallen off the stage instead of Martin that he wouldn’t’ve had a joke? You better believe he would have had a joke. He would have told people, “I saw Fluffy bounce.” [audience laughs] Not to mention the fact that you know that’ll make the news. I fall off the stage tonight, there’ll be a van out in front in an hour. “We’re standing here live in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, where authorities believe Fluffy lost control.” “Let’s go to Tom, who’s inside the venue who can fill us in with more.” “That’s right, Jim, I’m standing here at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, inside the venue where apparently Fluffy took a spill.” “It is still uncertain as to what happened here tonight.” “We did have a chance to interview local authorities who had this to say.” “Damn!” [audience laughs] “It is still uncertain if there was any problems with the stage.” “We did speak to security who had this to comment.” “I saw the whole damn thing. Okay?” “Whoo! Fluffy fell. He fell hard.” “I ain’t seen that many white people cry since a Taylor Swift concert.” “It was bad. It was bad. And in Miami. Are you kidding me?” “He hurt more Cubans than Castro.” [audience laughs] And that’s how you get canceled. So, uh, that’s the point I’m trying to make here. I made the news recently. Uh, without giving too much away, there’s an episode of Family Feud coming out very soon that I’m gonna be on. Yeah. [audience applauds] It is the celebrity edition, so it’s Fluffy and Fluffy’s family versus Fat Joe… [audience gasps] …and his family. So yeah, it’s Fat Joe versus Fluffy because apparently, the producers have a great sense of humor. [audience laughs] Long story short, I flew in some family from the East Coast to be on the show. The show went over very well. You’ll find out who wins later. Here’s the deal. The next day, my sister, who was one of the people I flew in, she hadn’t been in California in forever, and she was like, “Can we go to Disneyland?” And I’m like, “Sure, let’s go.” So it was her and her husband Gordy, and I took them to Disney. And we get on a couple of rides, and just so we’re clear, that’s not what made the news. [audience chuckles] I said that last night, someone was like, “‘Cause he fit.” No! [audience laughs] Some people. Right? Yeah. We get on the Cars ride at California Adventure, and halfway through the Cars ride, the car… [imitates engine revving, brakes screeching] …stops on the track. And my sister looked at me. She goes, “Is this supposed to happen?” I go, “No, the check cleared. We’re supposed to finish. This is, uh…” “We paid. It’s supposed to work. No, this…” It took the Disney people about 20 minutes to come get us and take us out of the car. So we’re sitting there, outside, in the sun for 20 minutes. I had no problem with that because I am mocha. I’m okay in the sun for 20 minutes. My sister, she’s twice as dark as me. She’s, like, freaking, you know, Apache. She’s… You know. Freaking Azteca. [chanting] Just, you know… Her husband, on the other hand, he’s from Minnesota. [audience laughs] He almost died. [audience laughs] “Oh, don’ cha know?” Yeah, so… while we’re sitting there in the car, waiting for the Disney people to come take us out of the car, the people waiting in line realize that the ride has been shut down. And so from the ride, you can see the line. People see the car on the track, and then they see who’s in the car. [audience chuckles] And all of a sudden, cell phones start comin’ out. And by the time we left Disney, TMZ had already reported the story, and you can google this, okay? TMZ reported the story. Before we left the park, it said, “Fluffy Stuck on LA Freeway at Disney.” [audience chuckles] I thought it was cute. I thought it was silly. I thought it was funny. I thought it was okay. Until I read the comments. [audience chuckles] Oh, some of you… are dicks. [audience laughs] One lady wrote, “Just ’cause you’re tall enough to ride doesn’t mean you’re small enough to fit.” [audience laughs] A guy wrote, “The car got tired.” [audience laughs] Another guy wrote, “You’re Mexican. Couldn’t you fix it?” [audience laughs] And that was Martin, yeah. So… [audience laughs] [imitates rim shot]',\n",
              "  'Anyway, so… The time before that, we made world news. Some of you might remember this story. The guys and I were involved in an emergency landing situation. I had, uh, chartered a private jet because my last Netflix special, the money finally hit my account, and I, you know, freakin’… I thought I was, y’know, ballin’, right? Nope. Turns out we were fallin’! Worst turbulence we have ever experienced in 27 years of being comedians. Uh, worst turbulence I ever felt, for sure. At one point, the jet did this. [whooshes] [audience chuckles] I did this. [imitates thud] [audience chuckles] The scariest part was watching my dogs leave the seat. Fortunately, we landed safely. We were okay. That’s not what made the news. What made the news is that, when we came in for the landing, the jet touched down, and then it skid off the runway by 200 yards, and we ended up in a field. A field. A field! Are you kidding me? As hard as I work… [audience laughs] [audience applauds] …to break stereotypes. [audience laughs] A bunch of Mexicans ended up in a field. Yeah, that’s what happened. [audience laughs] That’s how TMZ reported it. “Mexicans Found in Field.” [audience chuckles] In the movies, the pilots are always the first to know when there’s an issue. And in the movies, the pilots always have the courtesy of telling the passengers. They love to hear themselves talk. They get on the mic, “All right. It’s your captain speaking here.” “I just want to let you know we’ll be experiencing rough air.” “If you could just fasten your seatbelts, we’re gonna be A-okay. All right…” [murmurs] You know? If it gets bumpy, you know, [whooshing] [as captain, mumbling] “It’s your captain speaking.” “Somebody just had a little Mexican food here, so we… we’re feeling a little bumpy up here.” “We just had some fast food.” “Just a reminder to keep your seat belts fastened.” “We might be getting a bit… There we go. Just a bit there.” [laughs] “All right, I’ll be back with you in just a few seconds…” [mumbles indistinctly] If the plane’s going down, “Brace for impact!” “Hold on tight! We’re comin’ in hot!” Our pilot… nada. [audience laughs] Our pilot didn’t say anything until we came to, like, a complete stop. And then maybe like a minute later, the cockpit door opened up, and he stuck his head in, and he’s like, “You good?” [audience laughs] I was like, “My chihuahua’s in a cup holder. I am not good.” It was a scary situation, you guys, but let me tell you, even though we were involved in an emergency landing and we thought we were gonna die, I’m grateful for the experience. Believe it or not. I’m grateful because it reminded me how valuable life is and how quickly things can change. [audience applauds] Every now and then, we need a little reminder. We need to get shaken up a little to remind ourselves, “Oh my God. This is special.” “This is important. Enjoy it. Have fun.” The rest of the day after the landing, there was nothing anybody could tell me to ruin how good I felt to just be breathing and be alive. Nothing! [audience cheers and applauds] And so, that’s why I, uh… I’m grateful for bad moments. And I think bad moments are actually a good thing because we need balance in life. You need to have bad experiences in order to truly appreciate good experiences. Not every day can be the same. [audience applauds] You need to have a way to ba– Now, don’t get me wrong. Sometimes there’s too many bad days in a row. That shit sucks. And that’s actually what happened to me. After the near-death experience, I go home. I go home to find out that someone broke into my house. [audience gasps] Yeah. Yeah, I’m like, “Are you kidding me?” “That’s why I survived? To see this shit?” [audience laughs] The only reason why you haven’t heard about it until now is because the detective who’s working the case told me I’m not allowed to talk about it. In California. [audience laughs] Yeah, if the guys that broke into my house are here tonight… [scoffs] …bravo. [sarcastically] Bravo. That’s a flex and a half. No, they broke into my house, and of course, the number one question is, “What did they take from your house?” And what they took from me, honestly, it was my peace of mind. I didn’t feel safe in that house after. Uh, but if you must know, I did everything to prevent a break-in. I had, first of all, a good neighborhood. I had an alarm. I had two camera systems. I had a fence that surrounded the property. I thought I was good. Um, I got video footage of the entire robbery. [audience laughs] In 4K. [audience chuckles] Oh, that shit is crisp. I saw the guys that broke in, but I could not identify them because they were wearing masks. All I can tell you about the two guys that broke into my house is that they were 20 years old. I know they were 20 because when they jumped the fence and hit the ground, no pain. [audience laughs] If that would’ve been a 35-year-old with messed-up sciatica, he’d have thought twice about that fence. So, they jumped the fence, went in the backyard, and they broke the window and got in through the kitchen. They trashed my house. Okay, every drawer, open. Every cabinet, open. Everything got pulled out onto the floor so they could sift. Uh… Couches were flipped over, cushions were thrown down, and they pulled every single frame off the wall. And I asked the detective, I said, “Hey, look. I understand the drawers, the cabinets, and even the couch thing.” “But what’s the story with the frames on the wall?” “Why did they take everything off the wall but didn’t take any frames?” “Some of that stuff was art.” [as cop] “Mr. Iglesias, you have to understand something about these people that broke into your home.” “They were not looking for photos or art.” “They were actually looking for a safe.” I said, “A safe?” [as cop] “Yes, sir. A safe.” “A lot of times, in these homes, people will put a hole in the wall, install a safe, and then they’ll hang a frame over the safe to disguise that their valuables are in there.” I said, “A safe?” [audience chuckles] [as cop] “Sir, yes, a safe.” [as self] “But I just got this money.” [audience laughs] “Did they check the mattress?” [audience laughs] [as cop] “Don’t know.” [as self] “Let’s find out!” So, we walk into the master bedroom. I grab the edge of the bed, right? And I picked it up, and I was like, “Ah, stupid!” [audience laughs] “It’s all here.” Oh my God. These guys had no idea they were robbing somebody more ghetto than them. [audience laughs] So, at the end of it, they only got a couple of little trinkets from the drawers. Um, and that’s pretty much it. They made a mess of the house. They didn’t get any of the money. I’ll tell you what they did get. They got my guns. [audience exclaims] Now… I have never been open about the fact that I am, in fact, a registered gun owner. [audience cheers] Relax, Florida. [audience laughs] I’ve never been open about it because, quite frankly, it’s nobody’s business. Okay? However, it does pertain to the story that I’m about to share with you. Um, I am a recent gun owner. I became a gun owner in 2020, m’kay? Uh, yeah, when we were in the middle of… [loudly] …it. [audience laughs] Every morning watching the news, we didn’t know what was gonna happen, and it started to feel irresponsible, not preparing myself for a worst-case situation. Every morning watching the news, it felt like we were headed towards the Purge. [audience chuckles] Some of you are laughing, but think about this, the Purge would have taken less time. [audience chuckles] Yeah, the Purge. That’s how they should’ve woke us up, at least for entertainment purposes. [imitates alarm sounding] [feminine voice] “I’d like to thank you for your participation in the pandemic.” “The local time is 7:45 a.m.” [moans seductively] [audience laughs] Fear is why I decided to buy a gun. I was afraid, and I got no problem saying that. I was scared. We didn’t know what was gonna happen. Um, it’s only for protection. I don’t hunt. I don’t want to hunt. I don’t need to. I know where there’s three Chick-fil-As. [audience laughs] I’m good. I don’t go out on the weekends, you know? Pull! [imitates rifle firing] There’s no… [quacking] I still own a',\n",
              "  'Nintendo. I don’t need that shit. Fear is the only reason why I decided to buy a gun. So, I wound up at this sporting goods store right by my house. I walk in there, and this place is packed full of people that normally would not have been open to the idea of owning a gun, but they felt like me. They were scared, and rightfully so. I kept hearing the same conversation over and over and over. I kept hearing this… “I would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it.” [audience cheers] [audience applauds] And I don’t care where you’re from, that makes a lot of sense. And I was not about to let politics interfere with my personal safety. So, next thing you know… [audience cheers] So, next thing you know, I got in line. I had to get a ticket with a number like when you’re at the DMV or meat market. [in Spanish] The butcher shop. The bodega. “Number five!” [in English] I got in line. Forty-five minutes, I waited in line. And as soon as I get to the front, this guy comes to the counter, and he’s like… [in Southern accent] “How can I help you, son?” [as self] “Well, um…” By the way, I heard some of you chuckle, and just so we’re clear, I’m not saying that… all people [sighs] …who sell guns… [audience laughs] …talk like that. [audience laughs] But his name was Jim. [audience laughs] So, Jim was like, “How can I help you, son?” “Well, I’m here to see about purchasing my first firearm.” “Well, you’ve come to the right place. Know what you want?” “Or you need a hand?” [as self] “I’ve had some time to look at your selection, and I think I found something that’s gonna work for me.” [as Jim] “All right. Show me what you got.” “Okay, right over here in the case.” “This one?” “Yeah, right here.” “This one. The one right here, in the front.” “This one?” “No. Not that one. This one.” “This one?” “No. This one. Not that one.” “This one?” “No. The one in front.” “With the tag. The tag. Right here. The one that says two-two.” [audience laughs] [as Jim] “Um, sir, did you just call that gun… a ‘tutu’?” [audience laughs] [as self] “Yeah. What?” “Ji… Jim, right? Jim? Jim.” “Don’t look at me like I’m crazy, dude. I’m just reading the tag.” “It says it right here. In the front. It says two-two.” [as Jim] “You mean a .22?” [as self] “Well, yeah. I guess. Two-two, .22, same thing.” [as Jim] “Son, I hate to break it to you, but there’s a big difference between a tutu and a .22.” “But hey, this is California, so whatever floats your boat, son.” “All right?” [audience laughs] “Now, is there any particular reason why you have selected a, uh… a ‘tutu’?” [audience laughs] [as self] “Well, um, as impressive as your selection of guns here is, I recognize a lot of them from movies.” “It’s a bit much for me.” “Um, I’m very simple.” “Um, this gun looks very manageable.” “It’s small and, you know, it looks easy.” “Plus, it’s on sale.” “You know what I mean? Come on, man. A gun’s a gun, right?” [audience laughs] [as Jim] “Not exactly.” [as self] “Is this not a good choice?” [as Jim] “Son, you want my opinion, or you want to buy and be done with it?” [as self] “No, please tell me if I’m making a mistake.” “Is… is a… a .22 a good gun or a bad gun?” [as Jim] “Son, in my personal opinion, you’re better off tickling him, as far as I’m concerned.” [audience laughs] “All you’re gonna do is aggravate the situation.” “You’re just gonna piss him off is what I’m trying to tell you.” [as self] “Well, listen to my thought process.” “My whole idea for the gun is, I’m gonna use the gun more so like as a deterrent.” “So if somebody breaks into the house, they’re gonna see this big bald Mexican holding a gun, and then they’re gonna think twice and then rob my neighbors instead.” [as Jim] “Son, if somebody breaks into your house and they have a gun, they’re gonna know you’re holding a .22.” “And I’ll tell you what’s gon’ happen. They’re gon’ take it from ya.” [audience laughs] “And they’re gonna beat the holy hell outta you with it. Right?” “And the beating you’re gon’ get from a .22 is gonna hurt a hell of a lot more than the bullets out of a .22.” “That’s for damn sure.” [audience applauds] “Now, listen, I don’t know you, but I think I know your situation.” “And correct me if I’m wrong.” “You want to protect your home?” [as self] “Yes.” [as Jim] “Your family?” [as self] “Yes.” [as Jim] “Your valuables?” [as self] “Yes.” [as Jim] “All right, follow me.” “I think I got just what you need right here.” “M’kay?” “You see this right here? This here’s a 9 millimeter to start.” [crowd cheers] “Okay?” “A 9 millimeter is a solid firearm.” “Two to the chest, that man is going down, ten out of ten.” [audience laughs] “However, I got this special military-grade ammunition over here.” “I got this here bullet.” “It’s called a spreader.” “Yeah, it’s what I used to call my ex.” [audience laughs] “She was a real pistol too, let me tell you.” “That’s why I had to move to California. She’ll never find me here.” “So, this bullet, when it comes out the chamber, it opens up.” “And when it hits, it’ll leave a hole about yay big.” And stupid me, I said this, I said, “People survive that?” [audience laughs] [as Jim] “Survive?” “Survive?” “Son, you don’t want ’em to survive.” “You want ’em dead as fried chicken, as far as I’m concerned.” [audience applauds] I said, “I don’t want anybody to die.” [as Jim] “You don’t want anybody to die?!” “You guys hear that?” “You hear that? He don’t want anybody to die!” “Yeah! Oh yeah, you know who he voted for.” [audience laughs] [as Jim] “Look here, Tutu, you’re stressin’ me the hell out, man.” “I wanna help you, but you gotta want to help yourself, so listen.” “I’mma do everything in my power to get through this. Um…” “I’mma paint a picture for you, m’kay?” “You’re home.” “Someone breaks into your home.” “They have a gun.” “You have a gun.” “You have already told this person to leave or you will shoot, and they’re not leavin’.” “Matter of fact, they’re doing the opposite.” “They’re getting closer and closer and closer and closer.” “Now they’re so close, you can see the whites of their eyes.” “This individual is standing directly in front of you.” “You can see each other.” “This individual is prepared to do whatever it takes to leave with whatever they want, including taking your life.” “My question to you is, are you prepared to do the same?” “Are you willing to protect your family, your home, your valuables, and most importantly, yourself, in this situation?” “What are you gonna do?” [audience cheers] [as self] “First of all, bro.” [audience chuckles] “You should sell, like, life insurance, man, ’cause…” [audience laughs] “You’re missing your calling. I felt that. I felt it.” Um… “If I’m cornered like that, and I have absolutely no choice, and my life is in danger, I promise you, Jim, I will step up, man, and I will shoot them right in the leg.” “I will.” [audience laughs] [as Jim] “You think you’re gonna hit the leg, Mr. First-Time Gun Owner?” [as self] “Hey, if I buy that bullet you’re trying to sell me, that covers that much, up close, I can hit a leg.” “Two steps closer, I’ll shoot him in the huevos. I will, dude.” “I’ll hit a pelota. I will. No more babies, man.” [as Jim] “All right. All right. You don’t gotta get graphic on me, now.” “Son, you know what’s gonna happen if you shoot someone in your home, in the leg, and they live?” [as self] “Yeah. I know.” “I’m gonna sleep better, knowing I didn’t take a life and I was able to protect my home, my family, and my stuff.” “That’s what’s gonna happen.” [as Jim] Ah. “Clearly, you’re a Disney fan.” [audience laughs] [as Jim] “That’s about the biggest fantasy I’ve ever heard, right there.” “Son, I would ask you if you knew, but clearly, you don’t, so I’m not gonna waste my time spinnin’ my wheels on this one.” “I’m just gonna call it like it is.” “If you shoot someone in your home and they live, they can come back and sue your ass.” “That’s right. Now, here’s the kicker.” “They’re gonna',\n",
              "  'win.” “That’s right. They’re gonna win.” “And not only are they gonna get everything they wanted to get when they first broke in, when it’s all said and done, you are gonna cut them a big fat check.” “Now, what do you got to say about that?” I said, “That motherfucker’s gonna die!” [audience laughs] [audience cheering and clapping] He got excited. [as Jim] “Now, we’re talkin’!” I found out something that day. I found out that people that sell guns are a lot like people that sell used cars. They play on your emotions, and then they start to upsell you and make you buy things you don’t want or need. He knew I was scared because he kept saying it to me. [as Jim] “I know you’re scared.” “You’re scared, and your fears. You’re worried. You’re scared.” Every time he’d say “scared,” something else appeared on the counter. [audience laughs] He sold me so well that when he was done “selling me,” I wound up with four rifles… [audience laughs] …and four handguns and a case… a case of spreader ammunition. [audience chuckles] I hear some of you clapping, and why? It’s excessive. I only have two hands. [audience laughs] See, I feel, again, even though my home was burglarized, I feel grateful because I wasn’t there and I had my dogs with me. I can’t replace my dogs. I can’t replace me. [audience cheering] Stuff is stuff. However, if I would have been home, I would have done whatever I needed to do. That’s the difference. In this situation, there’s two kinds of people. One, people like me, had the guns, had the ammo, glad they weren’t there, but if they were there, they would’ve done something about it. ‘Cause if I was in bed and I heard the… [imitates crashing] …I would’ve jumped up. [grunting] I would’ve grabbed my gun. [imitates gun cocking] I would’ve ran out into the living room with no shirt on and one sock off. [audience laughs] I’d have confronted the person. “Freeze!” Knowing my luck… [audience chuckles] [as burglar] “Fluffy?” [as self] “I said, freeze!” [as burglar] “Oh, you’re funny. You’re funny, bro.” “You’re funny.” [as self] “Get on the ground!” [as burglar] “Oh!” [as self] “Don’t make me shoot you.” [as burglar] “Ah, hey!” [exclaims] “Hey, Beto, get in here! Get in here! You’ll never guess whose house this is!” The other guy runs in. [as Beto] “Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey.” “I grew up watching you.” [audience laughs and cheers] Next thing you know, I’m autographing things they’re about to take. [audience chuckles] [mouthing inaudibly] [audience laughs] [continues mouthing] [audience laughs] So like I said, in this situation, I feel like there’s two kinds of people. One, people like me. Had the guns, had the ammunition. Glad they weren’t home, but if they would have been home, they would have done something about it. That’s one type of people. The other kind of people are the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to… [scattered cheering] Oh. Good. You’re here. [audience laughs] The kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to confront an intruder because you know you have way more guns and ammunition than they do, and you are prepared for war. [audience cheers] The kind of people who sit home at night in the living room, in the dark, holding their gun. [audience laughs] [imitates rifle cocking] They leave the front door unlocked to make it easier. [audience laughs] And people like that always have a friend either across the street or across town. “How is everything over there on your side?” [imitating radio static] “It’s all clear over here. How about you?” “Yeah. Coast is clear. Ten-four. Out.” There. This situation, the break-in, left me traumatized. I couldn’t go back to living in the house because I didn’t feel safe. It’s just me and two chihuahuas. Yeah, that’s it. I’m no longer with my son’s mom, and my son lives with his mom. So, you know… And by the way, I told my son Frankie what happened, about the break-in, and right away, right away, “Oh, really? They’re lucky I wasn’t there.” [audience chuckles] I’m like, “Cálmate, John Wick.” [audience laughs] “They would’ve kidnapped you.” “I would’ve had to pay double to get you back.” I could not go back to living at the house. Again, it’s just me. So, I put the house up for sale. Uh, yeah, I just couldn’t. And it was a big beautiful home that you guys helped pay for. Thank you. [audience chuckles] It was nice. Real nice. Freaking four bathrooms. Four bathrooms. Yeah. One penis. [audience laughs] Even if I ran, I couldn’t, you know… I put the house up for sale, and here’s the dilemma that I faced. I put it up for sale before I had a new place to live because I figured I’m on the road, I’m always in a tour bus, a plane, a hotel, always somewhere. I’m on the go. I was just trying to get ahead of it because when I first bought the house, it was sitting on the market for almost two years. So I thought I had time. What happened was it sold like that because I had two people bidding on the house at the same time and they kept driving up the price. And one of the people trying to buy the house, he wanted all of my furniture and so my agent for the house goes, “Gabriel, this is crazy.” “These two guys are bidding on your house, and they want to give you way more than what you’re asking.” “One of them wants to give you an extra $100,000 for all of your furniture.” “I suggest you take it.” And so, I did. I sold the house with everything, except the mattress. Everything. The problem is I don’t have a house right now. I don’t have anywhere to live, so technically, I’m, um… [audience laughs] Fuck it. I’m homeless. I don’t care. [audience cheers] I’ll say it. I’ll say it. I’m not gonna be “unhoused.” I’m homeless right now. They can’t cancel me. What are they gonna do? Take my house? I don’t have one. Ha! [audience laughs] So whatever. Mm. But no, at this point, at… at 47 years of age, I don’t need more stuff. I’m happy that I do have stuff, but I don’t need it. What I want more than anything else now is better relationships. Better friendships, better people in my life, that’s what I want more than anything else. I announced in my last special at Dodger Stadium that I was no longer in a relationship. And I thought that was the best place to announce that because I’ve been very open about my life, my whole show is my life. People kept asking about her. So I thought that was the best place to announce that. You know what happens when you tell 50,000 people at a stadium that you’re single and then Netflix airs that around the world? I received thousands of “applications” for the Fluffy fulfillment center. Yes, I did. [chime dings] [Gabriel] That’s right, Netflix. Fluffy is hoein’ out. [audience chuckles] It was incredible. It was exciting. It was overwhelming, And it was terrifying because I didn’t know what they wanted. Um, well, I’m gonna tell you that since announcing that I was single, I’ve gone out on a few dates. And, uh, yeah. I don’t want to say how many, ’cause I don’t want your judgment. [chuckles] “Fluffy’s a whore.” [in English and Spanish] “He’s nasty.” [in English] “He’s like Santa with all his ho ho hos, yeah.” I still want to go out. I still want to have fun, I want to make connections, but unfortunately, I don’t trust people. I’m afraid. I can meet people really easy, but then I find out what they’re up to, and that sucks. Um, my heart is guarded now. Super guarded. There’s a wall and then a wall and then a wall and a wall and a wall. I’m like the only Mexican who likes walls. [audience laughs] So moving forward, I can tell you I don’t want to be in another relationship. I’m actually doing okay. I still want to go out, but I don’t want to be in a committed relationship. I… I don’t. No. [man boos] [grunts] What do you mean, “Boo”? The fact that I’m being honest about that I don’t want to be in a relationship, I think there’s something to be said about that. I could easily lie. Meet someone, say that we’re boyfriend/girlfriend, and have a thing. But does it mean anything if your behavior doesn’t change? I’m being up front and honest. All I want… All I want… All',\n",
              "  'I want, watch… To the guy that booed me for saying I don’t want a relationship. Raise your hand so I can… Okay, you’re famous, so… To you… What is your name? [man] Justin. Justin? Dustin. Dustin. All right, Dustin. Sorry for… “Dustin!” Like, all right, “Chill, bitch.” Yeah. Yeah, right? Freakin’ “‘Murica.” [Gabriel and audience laugh] All right, Dustin. Me not wanting to be in a traditional relationship is a honest thing because, uh, I can tell you, I don’t want to be in a situation where I’m obligated to participate in things that don’t make me feel like a good person. And at the age of 47, I’m tired of arguing, yelling, feeling guilted, feeling obligated, not smiling more. [audience cheers] I’m good, man. I… You know… But I still want to go out. So I just want to be up front and honest. All I need, Dustin, watch, is someone to eat with. [audience cheers] Someone to drink with. Someone to go to movies with. And someone to cuddle with. [audience cheers] That’s right. And they don’t even gotta be the same person. [audience laughs] All I’m saying is sometimes it takes a village. Okay? Dustin, I would love to tell a woman, “Hey, would you like to go see a movie?” [as woman] “Yeah.” Then we go. After the movie’s over, I go, “What did you think?” [as woman] “Good.” [as self] “Right?” “Would you like to see another movie?” [as woman] “Sure. When?” [as self] “Next week?” [as woman] “Good.” [as self] “Let’s stay in touch. See you next week.” “This is gonna be so cool. You like rom-coms. I like rom-coms.” “You like horror movies. I like horror.” “This is gonna work. I like this. I need this. [grunts] Can’t wait.” So I say, “All right, gotta go.” And she gets weird. [as woman] “Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.” “You gotta go? I thought this was going good.” [as self] “It’s going great. We’ll do more next week. This is cool.” [as woman] “But what’s the rush?” “Where are you headed? Where you going?” [as self] “Um…” “Uh, I’m about to call the cuddler. Why?” [audience laughs] [as woman] “The cuddler, what’s that?” [as self] “I got that covered.” “Okay, movies, that’s your lane. Stay in it, okay?” “This is us. We’re good. Solid. You’re the movie girl, okay?” Now, Dustin. I didn’t tell her. But I’m gonna tell you. When it comes to the department of cuddling, and this is so crazy because I’ve always been in a relationship and I could never be this open and honest, but now that I’m single, these are Fluffy’s flavors. [audience laughs] So, when it comes to the department of cuddling, this is what I want. I want a woman. A woman. A woman. With original factory settings. [audience laughs and cheers] [speaks indistinctly] This woman needs to be equal to, or greater than, in size. She needs to be a big girl. I prefer a big girl. I want a big girl. [audience cheers] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. This way, we both can agree on the temperature of the thermostat. [audience laughs and applauds] And only big girls know what I’m talkin’ about. [audience laughs] See, I’m a big boy, and as a big boy, I always run hot. Heat affects my mood. When I’m hot, Dustin, I become irritable, cranky, my anxiety goes through the roof. So for me to feel comfortable, I like to set the room to 68 degrees. Okay? [audience cheers] That’s right. And only a big girl can truly appreciate that. Skinny women, not so much. And let me tell you, I am tired of disappointing, skinny, cold women. [audience laughs] Skinny, cold women are mean. They’re mean. They don’t want it at freakin’ 68 degrees. No, they want 72, 73, 74. [in Spanish] You’re killing me. No! [in English] But I can’t do that to them. I can’t put them in 68 degrees. They get snippy. They get evil. They’re like, “Oh my God. What’s your problem?” “It’s so cold. It’s so cold. It’s so cold.” [as self] “Well, fuckin’ eat something.” [audience laughs] “I’m tired of sweating.” But, yeah. Anyway, Dustin, I apologize. I wasn’t trying to turn this into a TED Talk. [audience chuckles] I don’t want you to think that I don’t believe in love because I do, and anyone who can pull it off, I commend you for it. I have met so many couples over the years. I’ve met 20-year couples, 30-year couples, 40-year couples, 50-year couples. I met one 55. [audience cheers] Yeah. Yeah. I call them unicorns. I’ll tell you the story. I was in Savannah, Georgia. And I had just finished filming the second Magic Mike movie. Now… Yeah, I know. For those of you that don’t know, I was in Magic Mike. [audience cheers] Yes. I know. I was the only one who didn’t get naked. [audience laughs] Magic Mike, not Tragic Mike. So, let’s remember that, okay? I was the only one who didn’t get naked. So, um… Here’s the thing, after the movie, after we wrapped, my manager, Joe, tells me, he says, “Dude, man.” “Congratulations on another project.” “I want to take you out for a steak dinner.” I said, “Let’s go.” So he takes me to this restaurant called Ruth’s Chris Steak House. Now, very popular chain around the country. We go there, we sit down, and here comes the server and the server’s real bubbly. “Hey, guys. What’s going on? Are we celebrating anything today?” “Actually, yes, we are.” “Well, guess what? You’re not the only ones.” “You see that couple over there?” “That couple is celebrating 55 years of marriage today.” And we’re like, “What?” So, we look. [whoosh] [audience chuckles] I said, “How come they’re not talking?” [audience laughs] [as server] “I wondered the same thing, but the man made it a point to say 55 years.” “I thought that was pretty impressive.” I go, “No, it is.” So he leaves to go get us some sodas and some bread. And I tell my manager, I said, “Hey, Joe, listen.” “I’mma go say hi to the couple real quick.” [as Joe] “Don’t get us kicked out.” [as self] “I’m not gonna.” [as Joe] “Don’t make it like last time.” [as self] “It’s not gonna be.” So I get up, and I push in my chair, and I make my way over to the couple. Now, I understand how important this night is for them. I know exactly how long it took to get to that point, and I am not trying to mess that up. But I have questions. [audience chuckles] And these two people are clearly professionals in that department. So I approached the table as tactfully as I could. And I said, “Pardon the interruption.” “It has come to my attention that we are celebrating 55 years of marriage.” And the man was so happy that someone acknowledged that. He was just thrilled. He’s like… [breathing excitedly] [as older man] “That’s right, son.” “Fifty-five years ago today, this lovely lady sittin’ next to me right here said I do, and we’ve been together ever since.” [as self] “That is beautiful.” “May I ask you a question?” [as man] “Absolutely.” [as self] “How come you’re not talking?” [audience chuckles] [laughs as older man] “He wants to know how come we’re… Laugh, goddammit.” [audience laughs] “Son, when you’ve been together as long as the two of us have, you might’ve seen a thing or two.” Uh, uh… “We have children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.” “We have traveled this great big world of ours many times over.” “We’re both retired military.” “We have seen the best in people.” “And, unfortunately, when you’re around and alive as long as the two of us have been, uh, you’ve unfortunately seen the worst in people as well.” “We have had just about every type of conversation there is to have. [audience chuckles] At least twice. [audience laughs] And after 55 years of marriage, well, hell, we’re just trying to enjoy each other’s company, even if it’s in silence.” I said, “You’ve had every type of conversation there is to have?” And I guess I triggered him, because he was like, “Look at me!” “Look at me!” “I’ve been in combat.” “Nothing can faze me.” “Nothing can surprise me anymore.” [as self] “You don’t say.” [audience laughs] So, I took a step towards them, I grab my shirt, and I flash them. [audience laughs] And then I walked away. And you know what happened next? They started talking! [audience laughs and cheers] I gave that couple the greatest gift they will never ever acknowledge. Something new, something spontaneous, something outrageous, something neither one of them had ever seen before. I gave them a new story. I promise',\n",
              "  \"you, every year moving forward, all they’re gonna talk about is what happened at 55. [as older man] “Remember, honey. Remember when that Samoan flashed us?” [audience laughs] Right. ‘Cause I’m a giver. I remember many, many years ago, before there was a venue like this to perform in, the only place around here for comedians to do shows was at a comedy club right outside these doors that was part of the original layout of the casino. [audience cheers] It was a club called The Improv. There’s a chain all over. [audience cheers] And, you know, many, many years ago, before all of this, that’s where Martin and myself, my buddy Alfred, we’d go do shows at the… at the club. And the first time we got a chance to perform there, I didn’t really have a name. I wasn’t really established yet. And I want to take this moment to acknowledge and thank one person who was super, super helpful in that, a man by the name of DJ Laz. [audience cheers] That’s right, people. The Pimp with the Limp. Oh, yeah, Papá. Yeah. “It’s your boy, DJ Laz.” I love him, man. He’s great. He’s awesome. But yeah, he walks in circles. He does. He walks in circles. Nice guy. DJ Laz was one of the first people to allow me to be on morning radio with him, and he helped promote my shows. Not only would he allow me to go on his show and promote my shows, he would come to my shows, and he would bring people, and he’d watch and he’d sit and hang out and laugh. The man has a million things he can do in Miami, but he’d come watch my show. And then the next day, “Papá, come on the radio with me.” “We’re gonna talk about your show.” And he would help me sell out these shows year after year after year. So, Laz, I know you’re watching, Papá. Thank you. This is part of you, Papá. Muchas gracias. Thank you. Thank you. But that was many years down the line. In the beginning, the first time I performed at that comedy club, right outside these doors, that’s no longer there… Um, I’m talking to the marketing person. Now, keep in mind, this is so long ago, there was no social media. There was no TikTok, no freaking Twitter, no Facebook, none of that. The only way you could promote yourself back then was, you had to get on morning radio, morning news, have somebody do a write-up on you in the newspaper. Remember those? Yeah. And then, of course, word-of-mouth, which is always the best. Uh, they had posters at the comedy club. And so, the marketing guy goes, “Gabriel.” “Help me help you help us.” “We want to sell tickets. How do you want to be promoted?” I said, “Well…” Keep in mind, long time ago. I said, “Um, this is how I want you to promote my show.” “Please use a photo.” “Under the photo, put my name, Gabriel Iglesias.” I didn’t have the nickname Fluffy yet. That’s how long ago this was. I said, “Underneath that, please put, ‘As seen on Comedy Central.'” Because at the time, that was the only television credit I had. So the marketing guy goes, “Well, I was thinking, what about, ‘Gabriel Iglesias and his amigos’?” [audience chuckles] “‘Amigos’?” “Why ‘amigos’?” “Because I have other Mexicans with me?” And he looked at me and said, “Good. You get it.” [audience laughs] [as self] “I don’t like that. What about ‘Gabriel Iglesias and friends’?” “Well, we want to put a couple of buzzwords out there to let the community know what type of show it is.” I said, “What type of show is it?” [as guy] “It’s a special show.” [as self] “I don’t feel special.” [as guy] “Gabriel, hear me out. What about like a taco Tuesday?” [as self] “I don’t like it.” [as guy] “Okay, what about salsa night?” [as self] “Salsa night?” “Wait, like dancing or chips and guac?” [audience laughs] “Either one, I don’t like it.” I could not believe I was having this conversation, and I wanted to get upset. I wanted to go off on this guy for trying to make me feel like less of a person, right? But I didn’t, because I knew that if I went off on them, I would have been seen as difficult. I would have been seen as a problem, and I would not have been given another opportunity to come back. When people ask me, “What do you credit for your success?” Of course, talent, showing up, doing what you gotta do. But one word that gets left out a lot is the word “sacrifice.” I had to sacrifice something that day, and a lot of people think they know what sacrifice means but honestly, until you have to make one, I don’t think you do. I had to sacrifice my pride because as much as I wanted to go off on this guy, I knew that if I did, I’d be shooting myself in the foot. I knew that if they could see what I could do on that stage, they’d have to bring me back, and they’d have to treat me different. [audience cheers] So as much as it hurt, as much as it sucked, I allowed that stupid taco Tuesday to happen. So, for me, I was very upset. I was wondering, is this something that happens to all new comedians, or was I being singled out? It was killing me. I needed to know. I couldn’t just take out my phone and google it because that wasn’t an option all those years back. So what I had to do was I had to go to the front door of the club where they had a bin, and the bin had flyers in it. So I grabbed the flyer, and I looked at it. And the flyer had the list of upcoming comedy shows. And I was so upset when I saw it because all it was, was pictures, names, and television credits. No silly names, no theme nights, no “spicy this” or “crazy that.” Just comedy. So I said, “Why are they doing this stupid taco Tuesday thing to me?” So I said, “Let me try to find another comedian who’s a little bit more in my vein.” If you know what I mean. The only other comedian I could find was a man by the name of George Lopez. [audience cheers] With George’s promo, however, it was just a picture, name, and underneath that, a television credit that said, “As seen on ABC.” That’s it. It didn’t say, “Likes to ride a donkey, George Lopez,” “Eats a burrito with both hands, George Lopez.” “Ay, ay, ay. I just jumped the wall. It’s George Lopez.” No! So I said, “Why are they doing this to me?” So then I said, “All right, all right.” “Let me see how they promote the Black comedians.” And with the Black comedians, it was the same thing. Picture, name, television credit, and that’s it. Unless it was a show that had multiple Black comedians on it because if the comedy club had a show with three or more Black comics on it, they would put a catchy name to it. They would call the show “Urban Night” or “Apollo Night” or “Def Jam Comedy Night,” “BET Comedy Night,” “Black-ish Comedy Night.” But that’s as far as they would go. They wouldn’t go to the next level like they would for me. Oh, yeah. There was no “Margarita Monday” or “Taco Tuesday” or “Wetback Wednesday” or “Tortilla Thursday,” or “Fiesta Friday,” or “Sábado Gigante”! No. That would never happen to Black people. Are you kidding me? You’ll never see a “Malt Liquor Monday” or “Tupac Tuesday,” or “Watermelon Wednesday” or “Thong, Th-Thong, Thong Thursday,” or “Fried Chicken Friday” or “Sookie-Sookie Saturday” or “Slap-a-Ho Sunday”! [audience laughs and cheers] And that most definitely will not happen to white people. [audience chuckling] [scattered cheers] [speaks inaudibly] [cheering grows louder] Oh, I’mma do the joke. And you know why you can laugh and enjoy and not feel threatened by what I’m about to say? Because, like what I said earlier tonight, I am here to entertain, I am not here to offend. I’m here to have fun with everybody, starting with me. Plus, it’ll never happen. You’ll never see a “Monster Truck Monday” or “Trailer Park Tuesday” or “White Trash Wednesday” or “Take Your Sister Out Thursday.” [audience laughs] [in Southern accent] “Oh, hell no, Fluffy! You done crossed the line now!” “My name is Dustin, and I don’t play that shit.” [audience laughs and cheers] “I’m from Davie, goddammit.” [audience cheers] Next time, stay quiet. [audience laughs] So…\",\n",
              "  'I was talking to Martin backstage before I came out, and he goes, “Are you gonna share the story about the theme nights thing that happened at The Improv here, and y’know?” I go, “Well, y’know, I think I should, Martin.” “I think I should tell the story about, y’know, the theme nights.” He goes, “Gabe, can I tell you something about that theme nights bit?” I go, “Tell me, Martin.” [as Martin] “Do you realize that in all the years I have heard you tell this story about what happened at that club, do you understand that you’ve never once finished the week?” [audience chuckles] I said, “Martin, you know why that is, right?” “It’s the rule of comedy.” “You always want to end on the biggest laugh.” “Thursday gets the biggest laugh, which is why I stopped at Thursday.” And Martin goes, “I know, I know, I know.” “But you’re robbing white people of their week.” [audience laughs] I never looked at it that way. “Fox News Friday.” [audience laughs] “Storm the Capitol Saturday.” [audience laughs] “Say You’re Sorry Sunday”! [audience cheers] Are we still havin’ a good time? [audience cheers] Are we still having fun? [cheering grows louder] That’s what I’m talkin’ about. People laughing, not getting upset, not getting offended, not freakin’ making a stink. And let me tell you right now, for the five people who have never heard of me before, this… is for you. [scattered cheers] I get pulled over one night, two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-through. [audience cheering knowingly] I made a left turn instead of making a right turn, but I wasn’t paying attention, ’cause I had a box, right? I was like, “Oh, you’re gonna get it.” [chuckles enthusiastically] [exclaims, chuckles] “You’re gonna get it.” I make a wrong turn all of a sudden. [imitates siren] [groans] [imitates vehicle approaching] [grunts sadly] “Later.” [audience laughs] [gibbers indistinctly] The officer is taking forever. I said, “Forget this.” I grab the box of donuts. I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. I was like… [inhales sharply] Mm! [chuckles] Ah! [exclaims wildly] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window, and he’s like, “You know why I stopped you?” It was too easy. I picked up the box, and I said… [with audience] “‘Cause you can smell it!” [audience cheering] [crowd chanting] Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! [audience continues cheering] [chime dings] [Gabriel] You’re probably wondering, why did we pause the special again? Well, I just want to let you guys know most comedians would’ve already said, “Thank you, good night,” gone home, cashed their Netflix checks, and hope they get another phone call. “Please call me, Netflix.” [inhales] But this guy is not most comedians. That’s what happens when you hire a Mexican. We love overtime. [audience cheering] Thank you for still wanting to hear a joke that’s over 20 years old. [audience cheers] I grew up watching you too. [audience laughs] Got chills when I… [in Spanish] Look, look. [audience laughs] [in English] That was beautiful. I love you too, and that… Seriously, you guys, thank you for that. Thank you. [audience cheers] Thank you. There are fans, and then there’s what you just did right now. [audience cheering] I don’t know any other comedian that gets this type of love and loyalty. Thank you so much. I’m not getting off the stage yet ’cause I still got more to go, but I want to say thank you for that. [audience cheers] Thank you. [sighs dramatically] [audience cheering] [Gabriel] Whoo! So when I started doing stand-up in 1997, the only place that would allow me to go up on stage and do what I do were bars. Dive bars, rough bars. Uh, Martin and I, that’s where we met, many, many years ago. We’re performing at this bar in Montebello, California, and, uh, you had to fight with the crowd. You had to fight because there was noise. There were TVs on. People were drinking, smoking… People were doing everything in there but paying attention. So you had to come out quick, trying to get them to laugh. And one night, this comedian pulls me aside, and he goes, “Hey, kid.” And when he called me kid, I got upset. I’m like, “I could drink.” [audience laughs] I was 20, 21 years old, and, you know, even though I thought I was grown, I wasn’t. I wasn’t grown. Uh, I got upset that he pulled me aside. He goes, “Can I give you some advice?” I’m like, “Who does this guy think he is? I’m funnier than him.” That’s what I thought because at the age of 21, I was a punk. I really was. And so, I don’t know what got into me where I said, “Sure, I’ll hear you out.” And I just stood there, and he said, “Listen.” “Um, you’re really likeable on stage, and that’s rare.” “I’m gonna give you a bit of advice.” “If you cut all the cussing out of your show and start taking the filthy material out, I think you’re gonna have a long career ahead of you.” And I know I said “take the cussing out” and I… I said the F-word twice tonight. [audience chuckles] Technically, no, three times. I said it three times. Um, but I’m mindful of it. I’m keeping count. It’s not every other word. Plus, we’re in a casino. [audience cheers] Okay. No one loses their ass and says, “Aw, shucks.” No. [audience laughs] I heard some of you cussing before. “When the fuck is this gonna start?” Yeah, I heard you. I heard you. [in Spanish] I’m fat, not deaf. [in English] I heard you, goddammit. So anyway, he gives me this advice. Cut the cussing out of your show, take out the filthy material. And I don’t know why I listen, but I did, and he was absolutely right. All of a sudden, I started getting opportunities left and right. I started getting booked at colleges, high schools, churches, fairs. And then the big one, casinos. [audience cheers] [cheering fades] Back in the day, you had to be squeaky-clean to perform at a casino. Uh, but that’s not the case anymore. If you can sell tickets, it doesn’t matter what you do, they want to book you. But back in the day, there was only a few people who could pull it off. I was fortunate to be one of those people. So I remember, I got booked to perform at a casino called Morongo in Southern California, and I’m backstage with the booker, the lady that hired me for the function, and she goes, “So, no cussing, right?” I go, “No. No cussing.” [as booker] “No filthy material?” [as self] “No filthy material.” [as booker] “Good luck.” And it was just me. I didn’t have openers. It was just me. It was a voice-over on the frickin’ speaker, right? “Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome comedian, funny man Gabriel Iglesias.” And then I just… I walked out there, right? I offended the entire audience… [audience chuckles] …in five seconds. And I did it without cussing. Frickin’ 22-year-old kid goes up on stage, looks at the crowd and says, “Hey, everybody! Is this a regular casino, or is this an Indian casino?” [audience groans and laughs] You see how you all know? [audience laughs] I didn’t know. I didn’t know because I didn’t have TikTok to teach me. [audience chuckles] What I did have was a life experience that I’ll never forget. As soon as I said that, the entire front row, which comprised of the tribal members from the casino, they all stood up, and one of them called me out in front of the entire audience. “Hey! Hey! You don’t say that anymore!” “The proper term is Native American.” “Please show respect.” And I was like, “Oh my God. I’m so sorry. I didn’t know.” And I felt horrible, and I was so embarrassed. Fortunately, I had a second show at ten o’clock. Ten o’clock hits. I take the stage. I didn’t need to be told a thousand times that I messed up. That one time of me getting shamed in front of the entire audience was all I needed. That’s why I’m a firm believer in shaming. [audience laughs] I think shaming is good. Shaming is good as long as you shame with purpose. If you’re about to teach someone a valuable lesson, I say go for it because it worked for me. I got shamed one time. Second show, ten o’clock. I took the stage. Ooh, it was different. I was like, “Before I get started, ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to take this opportunity',\n",
              "  'to thank all of the Native Americans who are here tonight.” “Thank you for this opportunity to perform in your casino.” “I hope you enjoy the performance.” [audience cheers and laughs] I thought I was good. All of a sudden, another tribal member in the back jumped up. And he’s like, “Hey, drop the ‘American’! Just say ‘Native’!” [audience laughs] [as self] “‘Kay!” [audience laughs] That stayed with me. That was powerful. That was scary. Next time I did a casino, first thing I said was, “I would like to acknowledge all of the Natives who are here tonight,” and then someone yelled out, “We’re Indigenous!” Fuck me! That’s four. [audience laughs and cheers] [chime dings] With time, I got a chance to perform all across the United States, and then I get my first-ever show in Canada. Ironically enough, at a casino. [audience laughs] It’s a casino we still perform at called Caesars in the city of Windsor, Ontario, right across the water from Detroit, Michigan. [audience cheers] I come to find out the hard way that in Canada, it is a completely different term for describing the… people… [audience chuckles] …originally from that land. The proper term in Canada is actually “First Nation.” I didn’t know that. I was so nervous being in Canada, I said, “Native American.” [audience laughs] Like, “Hello?” I’m not even in America, right? Frickin’ stupid, right? Pendejo, I know. [audience laughs] Fortunately, someone pulled me to the side, and they told me what was up. I was lucky that I had a second show. Ten o’clock, I take the stage, and I’m like, “Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge all of the First Nation people who are here tonight.” Then some guy yells out, “Call us Indians!” [audience laughs] This guy in the front row was like… [in Indian accent] “They’re not Indian.” [audience laughs] [in Indian accent] “They are not Indian!” [as self] Canada has always been an adventure. There was one show that we did at the same casino. Anytime now, we perform outside of the United States, even if it’s next door in Canada or Mexico, Martin’s first question to the audience is, “Do we have any Americans in the house tonight?” Because no matter where we perform in the world, there’s always a handful. So that night, Martin takes the stage, and he asked the question, “Do we have any Americans here tonight?” Not knowing that earlier in the day, at that same casino, in the grand ballroom, there was a… a end-of-year holiday party from an American company from right across the water in Detroit. And they were having this end-of-year celebration, and they were there, pre-gaming since noon. [audience chuckles] Partying it up. And I guess the… the party planner for the event thought it would be an amazing idea to end their party with laughter. So this person bought all of the tickets to my show that night and gave them to that company. Well, seven o’clock rolls around, and everybody stumbles in, takes their seats, and then Martin walks out, and he asked the question, “Do we have any Americans?” And instead of getting a “Yay,” “Whoo,” “Right here,” he got… [imitates crowd roaring] They were so drunk, they started chanting. “USA! USA! USA! USA!” I’m in the dressing room, hearing this. I’m like, “Why are we here?” [audience laughs] “We could have done this in Detroit.” You know? I had to fill out paperwork. I’m like, “This is not cool.” So during intermission, Martin comes backstage and he tells me, “Bro, I don’t know if you heard…” [as self] “Oh, I heard.” [as Martin] “Might wanna mention it.” I go, “Oh, I will.” So at some point during my performance, I told the audience, “So, a little bird told me there might be a couple of Americans here tonight.” “Is that true?” Sure enough… [imitates crowd roaring] And they started doing it again. [chanting] “USA! USA! USA!” Then it got quiet, and you could hear, “‘Murica.” [audience laughs] I said, “Ladies and gentlemen, do you understand what just happened?” “We just made history.” And people in the front row, they’re like, “What are you talking about, history?” I said, “We just made history.” “Who would have ever thought you’d see the day where thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of Americans would cross a border… [audience laughs and cheers] …to see a Mexican?” [audience cheers] Thank you for 27 years of supporting this Mexican.

[siren wailing] [somber music playing] [Harvey Levin] Jamie Foxx suffered a very serious medical emergency. Bad enough that family members flew in. Actor Jamie Foxx is asking for prayers as the actor has now spent more than two weeks in an Atlanta hospital. Foxx literally died and had to be revived. That’s what the health emergency was. Somebody in the clone department gettin’ lazy, bro. It’s not Jamie Foxx. My gut feeling is telling me that Jamie Foxx is dead. [distorted] Dead. Dead. Dead.

And all the time! [crowd] God is good! Man, I ain’t gonna make it through this shit. [crowd cheers] Atlanta saved my life. [crowd cheers] Atlanta saved my life. The internet tried to kill me, though. [crowd jeers] [Jamie] They said I was paralyzed. [man] That’s right. Said I couldn’t walk. But look at me now.

[woman laughs] [crowd cheers] [sighs] Atlanta saved my life. [audience cheers] The internet was trying to kill me, though. [crowd murmurs] The internet said that Puffy tried to kill me. [crowd jeers] That’s what the internet was saying. I know what you’re thinking, “Did-he?” [all laughing] Hell naw, n*gga. I left them parties early. I was out by nine, n*gga. “Somethin’ don’t look right, n*gga.” “It’s slippery in here, n*gga.” [crowd gasps and laughs] Atlanta saved my life. [crowd cheers] The internet tried to kill me. Katt Williams! [audience jeers] Katt Williams got in on it. Did y’all see the special? Katt Williams said he knew. [imitating Katt] “Jamie Foxx got so much money.” “They say he’s sufferin’ from a mystery illness.” “A mystery illness?” “What the ♪ Fuck?” ♪ That shit sound just like that, n*gga. [crowd cheers] That n*gga said… “Goddamn, that sound… [imitating Katt, dramatically] …a mystery illness.” “What the fuck?” [scoffs] That n*gga turned into the Wicked Witch of the West. [imitates Wicked Witch] “A mystery illness.” “I’ll get you my little Jamie and your little dog Toto too.” [cackles] [crowd laughs] Katt will say 2,000 things that don’t make sense, right? But then say four things that make sense and put “sir” after it. “The glass is half full, sir.

And I appreciate every prayer, man. Now, what’s interesting is Katt Williams might be onto something. Because it is a mystery. [clicks tongue] We still don’t know exactly what happened to me. [sighs] All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer. Because I needed… every prayer. I appreciate every well-wish,',\n",
              "  'Atlanta. Uh… to the world, I… I can’t thank you enough, even when I see people on the street, and they roll their window down and yell out, “Man, we glad you here.” As I look out, and I see my family and I… see my friends. [clicks tongue] I can’t tell you how good it feels. If you could see it through here… it feels amazing. [crowd cheers] It actually happened here in Atlanta. A little history, Atlanta, I started doing stand-up comedy back in 1991, right here in Atlanta. So it’s fitting that I came back here to tell you, uh, the story because… what had happened was… [clicks tongue] [sighs, exhales deeply] [sniffles] [woman 1] We love you. [woman 2] Atlanta saved your life. Hey, hello. You did. [crying] Wow. Man, please, Lord. Let me get through this. [crowd cheers] Please. [woman 3] All right, you got it! You got it! [cheering continues] April 11th, I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for a aspirin, and I realized quickly that when you in a medical emergency, your boys don’t know what the fuck to do. And I was like, “Damn.” But I was having such a bad headache. So, I asked my boy, I said, “Listen, I need a… a… a aspirin.” Before I could get the aspirin… [ominous tones play] [clicks tongue] …I went out. [sniffles] [music fades] I don’t, um… I don’t remember 20 days. [woman 1] Oh, man. [audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What they told me was, was that… [clicks tongue]…they took me to the first doctor. And that doctor just gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home. [crowd murmurs] Yeah, I don’t know… What the fuck is that? [crowd chuckles] I don’t know if you can do Yelps… [audience chuckles] …for doctors, man. That’s half a star, n*gga. [audience laughs] You know? “No, he good. Give him that.” Man, what the fuck? But my sister… said, “No.” [woman] All right. Four foot 11… of nothin’ but pure love said that something’s wrong with my brother. She came over to see me, and I was… They told me I was leth… lethargic. And she says, “Get him in the car. That ain’t my brother right there.” My little sister who’s always played the background, now gotta play the lead. [man] Amen. [inhales sharply] They say she drove around Atlanta, sorta aimlessly. She didn’t really know where the hospitals was. But as she was drivin’ around, she came up on Piedmont Hospital. Give it up for Piedmont. [crowd cheering] What’s interesting about it is that as she drove around, she didn’t know anything about Piedmont Hospital, but she had a hunch that some angels is in there. [woman 1] Mm-hmm. [crowd murmurs in agreement] ‘Cause she said, “That’s what we gon’ need.” [scattered applause] [man 1] All right. [woman 2 whoops] [man 2] Yes! [woman 3] Hallelujah! [woman 4] Love you. Love you. [woman 5] Atlanta saved your life! Atlanta saved my life. [crowd cheering] So they tell me my sister took me into the hospital. And this cool white boy, Dr. Schuette… Cool white boy. They say he had on a Laker jersey. Just cool as shit, you know? But… he told my sister some horrible news about… her big brother. He said… “He’s havin’ a brain bleed… [audience murmurs] [Jamie sighs] …that’s led to a stroke.” [clicks tongue] Damn. [emotionally] Me. Me, man. Me. [softly] Wow. Here’s the thing. When you dream about what you want to be in life, you don’t dream tragedy. [crowd] No. You dream everything is good. “I… I got the life. I got the cars.” “I got all that.” [sniffles] You don’t dream that something would go wrong. But when something does go wrong… you need a sister. Four foot 11. [crowd] Mm-hmm. Full of nothin’ but love. [audience cheers and applauds] [sighs, sniffles] The cool doctor with the Laker jersey, white dude, said, “Listen.” “He’s havin’ this brain bleed that led to a stroke, and if I don’t go in his head right now, we’re gonna lose him.” [audience murmurs] [clicks tongue] What I was told was my sister fired right back and said, “You can go in his head, but you ain’t gonna find nothin’.” [audience laughs] He said, “Why you say that?” She said, “Have you seen how big this n*gga’s head is?” [audience laughs] My sister made a joke because sometimes you gotta laugh… [crowd] To keep from crying. …to keep from cryin’. [crowd murmurs in agreement, applauds] [cheering] What actually happened was the doctor said, “If I don’t go in his head, we’re gonna lose him, and she fired back and said, “You can go in his head, but you’re not gonna find anything ’cause I already talked to God.” [woman 1] That’s right. [crowd cheers] The cool white doctor, named Dr. Schuette, shot right back and said, “I’m a religious man too.” [woman 2 whoops] [woman 3] All right. But I gotta do my job. [woman 3] All right. So, what I was told is that they take me in to operate on me, and, uh, my sister knelt down outside the operating room and prayed the whole time. [woman 3] All right. [quietly] Your life doesn’t flash before your face. It was kinda… oddly peaceful. I say this all the time. I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. I didn’t see the light. [audience chuckles] I was in a tunnel, though. It was hot in that tunnel. [woman 1] Ooh! [audience murmurs and chuckles] [laughing] [audience murmurs] Shit, am I goin’ to the wrong place in this motherfucka? ‘Cause I looked at the end of the tunnel, and I thought I saw the devil. Like, “Come',\n",
              "  'on, n*gga.” [audience chuckles] Or was that Puffy? [audience gasps and laughs] [Jamie] I’m fuckin’ around. But if it was Puffy, he had a flamin’ bottle of Johnson &… No, I’m just kiddin’. [imitating Puffy] “Come on in!” No, I’m just kidding. [laughter dies down] No, I saw the tunnel. I didn’t see the light. [clicks tongue] But my sister… [sniffles] …prayed the whole time. And when that cool white dude… [sniffles] …Dr. Schuette came out, he said, “Well, um, you was right.” “Your prayers are answered. We didn’t find where it was comin’ from.” “But he is havin’ a stroke.” “He may be able to make a full recovery.” “But it’s gonna be the worst year of his life.” [sniffles] That’s what it was, Atlanta. You finally got the story. [man] Amen. [clicks tongue] [woman] Saved your life! Saved my life. [crowd cheers] That’s why this moment is the most incredible moment. ‘Cause you do take it for granted. [sniffles] But I’mma tell you something about my sister, Deidra Dixon, and my daughter Corinne Marie Foxx. [dramatically] They held me the fuck down! [audience cheers] “Nobody sees him!” They cut it all off. [crowd cheers] They held it down. They didn’t want you to see me like that. I didn’t want you to see me like that. I want you to see me like this. [crowd] Yeah! [audience cheers] There’s another reason too why my daughter didn’t want nobody to see me ’cause I was dizzy from the… the stroke. I was so dizzy. So, my head would do this. [crowd laughs] Stop… Stop laughing. Laugh. Go ahead, n*gga. I understand. But she says, “They gon’ meme the fuck outta this motherfucker.” [crowd laughs] ‘Cause I was doing that. [laughs] But now I have a better appreciation when I see people out and they doing this. I be like, “Oh, I know what that is. What’s up?” [crowd laughs] “What’s up with you?” “What’s up? Just chillin’.” “Just hangin’ out. What’s new?” I know. It’s fucked up, right? [audience chuckles] Yeah. [chuckles die down] [woman] You look good! [Jamie] Thank you so much. I feel good. [audience cheers] Twenty days I don’t remember. [sniffles] But on May 4th… [crowd] Yeah? I woke up. [snaps] [crowd cheers] And when I woke up, I found myself in a wheelchair. I couldn’t walk. [audience groans] Couldn’t walk, bro. In a wheelchair, and I was like, “What the fuck is…?” “Why am I in a wheelchair?” I’m just coming out of some shit. I looked at Dave Brown. I said, “What am I doin’ in a wheelchair?” He said, “Foxx, you don’t remember?” “No! Why?” “What y’all doin’?” He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” [clicks tongue] “Dave, knock it off. Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.” [audience chuckles] He said, “You don’t remember?” “I don’t remember, but I know Jamie Foxx ain’t got no stroke.” “‘Cause I’m Jamie Foxx. Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx.” [audience laughs] He said, “Foxx, you had a stroke.” “And don’t try to get out of that chair, ’cause you can’t walk.” I said, “N*gga…” [hesitates] “Shit!” [audience laughs] “What the fuck you do to my legs, Dave?” I said, “Dave…” [splutters] “What’s going on, man?” He said, “Foxx, it’s real.” “Come on, Dave, man. That’s a horrible joke.” [man 1] You right! I said, “Jamie Foxx don’t get strokes.” [sighs] [crying] “It’s a bad joke, Dave.” [sniffles] “I don’t get strokes. Come on, man.” [audience murmurs sympathetically] [man 2] We love you, man. I love you back. [audience cheers] [quietly] “I don’t get strokes. I don’t get strokes.” “That’s old man shit, man. I don’t get no strokes, n*gga.” Stop this fucking… prank. [sniffles] [clicks tongue, sniffles] They flew me to Chicago for my rehab. Chi-town. [audience cheers] Right there. They took care of me. Shirley Ryan, right over there. [audience cheering] Took care of me. [clicks tongue] But when I got to the rehab, there was this lady that was all over me. She was all over me, brushin’ my teeth, and… and… and… and washing my face, fixin’ my clothes, pushin’ my wheelchair. And I’m like, “Damn…” [mumbles] [audience laughs] “Who is this bitch all over me, man?” “She all over me, n*gga. She all over me, n*gga.” I said, “Dave, is she a fan? Did she see Django? Like, what? Shit.” “Why she all over me like this, dawg?” And Dave says something that stopped me in my tracks. He says, “Foxx, that’s your nurse.” I said, “What kind of old man shit is that?” So, the first night, she says, “Okay. Time for the showers.” I say, “Okay. Somebody put me in the chair, get me to the water, I’ll knock it out.” She says, “No, I’m gonna bathe you.” I said, “No, the fuck you ain’t.” She says, “Well… “I say, “No, no, no.” “You not finna… No. You not finna see this pickle.” [audience laughs] She said, “What you mean?” I say, “Uh-uh. It’s…” “Why?” I said, “No. ‘Cause there’s shit goes along with this pickle.” “I’m Black.” [audience laughs] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “It’s a whole lot of shit goin’ on here with this pickle.” “I just can’t let you see this pickle just on… out the package that quick.” [audience laughs] I said, “There’s something wrong with it. I don’t know if it’s been cold.” Fellas, you know how it is. You don’t ever take your pants off right away in front of your girl. You gotta… pump some oil in that motherfucker. Your girl… Ever pull your drawers up? “Bitch. Hold on!” [crowd laughs] “What’s wrong?” “Ain’t nothin’ in this motherfucker yet.” And that shit be stuck to your thighs. She’s like, “Are you okay?” “No! You got to give me a three count.” [audience',\n",
              "  'laughs] “Give me a three count before you expose my pickle like that.” I gotta… You know… That bitch… Even if we ain’t finna fuck, it gotta have a certain… [inhales sharply] So, I’m sayin’ this to the lady. I said, “You can’t see my pickle,” and she hit me with some crazy shit. She said, “J, you don’t remember, do you?” “What?” “I’ve been bathing you for the past month and a half.” [audience exclaims, laughs] [imitating Katt Williams] I said, “Mystery illness?” [audience laughs] “What the fuck?” She been bathing me for a month and a half. I said, “You been in there?” She says, “All in there.” Goddamn! – “All in there?” [emphatically] “Yes, all in there.” [inhales sharply] Fuck! That affected me more than the stroke. I’m like, “Damn, is my dick dead?” [crowd laughs] “Because I need my dick!” [audience laughs] But, yeah. She said she’d been all in there, and then I asked a silly question. I said, “Well, was I representin’?” [audience laughs] She says, “I don’t know what that means.” She don’t, but we know what that means, right, brother? I’m like, “Fuck!” [inhales sharply] “Shit!” “She’s seen it!” “And I don’t remember her seein’ it!” So it hit me. I ain’t seen my dick in 20 days. So I rush to the bathroom, pull my pants down, look down. That motherfucker had a stroke too. [audience laughs] I said, “Man, what’s wrong, n*gga?” “You tell me, n*gga, what’s wrong?” “What happened?” “I don’t know. The lights went off.” [audience laughs] “You cool?” “No, I ain’t cool!” “Did you see the nurse?” “I seen the bitch. I didn’t do nothin’.” [audience laughs] Uh… [chuckling] [clicks tongue] Then it was the process of the therapist. They’d bring therapists for my therapy, and I didn’t want to hear that shit. I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need no fuckin’ therapists. Why did this shit even happen to me? I’m Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx. So, every therapist that came in, I said, “Get the fuck out.” “I don’t want to do this shit.” I… I… I felt like, uh, Wesley Snipes in New Jack City. When he was at the table at the end and Gee Money would walk up. [as Gee] “Yo, you, Nino.” [as Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] “Huh.” “Is that what this is about? Over a fucking skeezer?” “I don’t give a shit about that ho bitch.” [crowd laughs] [scoffs] “Yeah, yeah.” “Don’t nobody know nothing, huh? Hmm, well, I’ll be goddamned.” “Huh. Hmm. Ha. Huh.” [audience laughs] [as Gee] “If you’d have been…” [as Nino] “What?” “If I’d have been what?!” “That’s what I thought you said. ‘Cause that’s all I got.” “Nothin’!” [audience laughs and cheers] “Now, leave me.” [imitating Gee] “Yo, Nino.” [imitating Nino] “Get the fuck out.” [audience laughs] That’s my movie. [chuckles] Remember the old dude? [imitating Bill Cobbs] “Your soul is required in hell, young man.” “Look at you in here, sellin’ drugs to your own people.” [chuckles, imitating Nino] “Cancel this bitch. I’ll buy me another one.” “Sit your five-dollar ass down…” [crowd] “Before I make change!” [Jamie] That’s my audience. That’s Atlanta! Huh. Yeah. [crowd cheers] I was Wesley Snipes. I was arrogant. “I’m Jamie Foxx. I don’t need nothin’. I don’t want to see no therapist.” They say, “You got a second chance.” “I don’t want a second chance.” “What’s wrong with my first chance?” What’s wrong with my first chance? So, I was… irreverent. I was… I gave up. [sniffles] Then… I heard in the other part of the room… I heard ’em go, “We need Holly.” [audience chuckles] Who the fuck is that? “We need Holly for this one. Only Holly can get him goin’.” “Holly is the one.” I’m like, “I don’t give a fuck about no Holly.” “She gon’ get the same shit.” “And she comin’ here on that bullshit.” You know them movies, “It’s only one person could do this.” “We gotta get Holly.” I’m like, “Man, bull-Holly.’ [sniffles] [audience laughs] I’m layin’ in my bed. That’s all I could do every day. I could walk a little bit, but I couldn’t walk. So it’s early in the morning. I hear, “Get up!” Goddamn! “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience laughs] [woman] Oh, damn. I said, “Hey, Holly.” [imitating Holly] “Yes, listen. You gotta knock this shit off.” “This whole Jamie Foxx shit.” “Stop this arrogant bullshit.” “That stroke doesn’t give a fuck about who you are.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker.” [audience cheers] [woman] Go, Holly! “All of this ‘I’m Jamie Foxx’ and this Wesley Snipes shit you’re doin’.” “New Jack City.” “Fuck that city.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, and I can get you there, but you gotta tell me the truth and cut this ‘Jamie Foxx’ shit.” I say, “Yeah, miss lady, I’m good.” “Oh, you good?” “You can beat this?” I say, “Yeah.” “Walk to me now.” I said, “Yeah…” [audience chuckles] [woman 1] Aww. [woman 2] Oh. [man] Damn, bro. She said, “I can help you, Jamie Foxx.” [sniffles] “But you gotta tell me what’s really goin’ on with you.” “You’re dizzy, right?” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” “You’re so dizzy, you can’t walk.” I say, “Yes, ma’am.” She says, “You remember the movie Karate Kid?” I say, “Yes.” She said, “We gonna wax on… [with audience]…wax off.” [audience cheers] I said, “What that mean?” She says, “I’m gonna help you with that so you can go back to bein’ a man.” She said, “Take your right hand, and put it on your left shoulder.” “Your left hand on your right shoulder. Now close your eyes.” And I fell. She picked me back up. “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “I want you to look left, and I want you to look right.”',\n",
              "  'I look left. I look right. I fell. She said, “Come on, Jamie Foxx.” “This is it. Look left and look right.” I look left. I look right. I got that. And then she said, “Now, Jamie Foxx, now you got that? I want you to look up and look down.” I look up, look down, I got dizzy. I fell back in my bed, and I said, “Miss Holly, I don’t want to do this no more, man.” “What has happened to me?” [shakily] “I’m Jamie Foxx.” “I don’t want to do this.” And she said, “I got 15 more minutes left.” [audience laughs] “I’m Holly, motherfucka.” [applause] [woman] Holly! “You look left, and you look right.” I looked left, right. She said, “Go to sleep!” [snores] [crowd laughs] The next mornin’… “Get up!” Goddamn, bitch. You gotta get a bell around your neck or somethin’. [audience laughs] She said, “Look left, look right.” Huh? “Look up! Look down!” I said, “Yeah.” “You gotta kill that old Jamie Foxx in order for the new Jamie Foxx to walk outta here.” “I’m Holly, motherfucker!” [audience cheers] Next morning came, Holly came in. I was already out of bed. “Hey, bitch.” [audience laughs] “I knew you was coming, bitch. I’m up!” “Knock it the fuck off.” “Left, right, up, down. Get the fuck outta here.” So I got down again, and Holly took me into the big facility, but there’s other patients in there, and I was down in the dumps. She says, “What’s your fuckin’ problem?” “What is your problem? You don’t want to fight?” She said, “Jamie, when you walk in this facility, look to the left of you, people that ain’t gonna get outta here.” [audience groans] And I did. I looked… There was a quadriplegic. There was a person in a wheelchair. There was another guy’s whole side was gone. She said, “They not gettin’ outta here.” There was one little white lady. All she could do was… turn this little pinwheel. She said, “What do you think now?” And I wept. Cryin’. I said, “God, to all the blessings, go over there.” [man] Yes. [Jamie crying softly] So, then they called my… my psychiatrist, Dragana. He knew I was going through some shit. He says, “What’s goin’ on with you? Why can’t we just talk it out?” I said, “Dragana, we can’t, man, ’cause I’m angry.” “I don’t know why this is happenin’ to me.” And as I said that, I knew why this was happenin’ to me. It was God. [woman] There it is. [gently] It was God. It was God. I talked to him different. I was like, “Hey, man. You sure you got the right dude?” He says, “Who’s this?” I say, “It’s Foxx!” “Who?” “Foxx!” “Come on, G, it’s J!” “Foxx! Jamie Foxx.” “The one down here puttin’ smiles on people’s faces.” “Who?” I said, “Damn. You want my government name? Eric Bishop.” [audience laughs] “Terrell, Texas? The one that beat the odds, that got the Oscars?” “The one that got the Grammys? C’mon, G. It’s J.” “Come on, man!” He said, “What’s up, my n*gga?” [audience laughs] You can tell by that phrase alone that God is not white. [crowd laughs] ‘Cause I wouldn’t even let the Messiah call me that. That’s how me and God talk. I said, “Damn, man, you sure? Why am I going through this?” “Is it a clerical error?” “Did Peter write down the wrong name? I mean, did you read it wrong?” “I’m not sayin’… I’m just sayin’, you been at this for a while.” “Maybe you just… read that shit wrong, my n*gga.” [crowd chuckles] He said, “No. This should be happenin’ to you.” I said, “What? Why?” I said, “God, look at all these bad people.” [crowd murmurs] “Look at all these bad people down here.” “Shouldn’t these bad people be goin’ through this?” You know what he said? “Those bad people already belong to somebody else.” [audience exclaims and murmurs] “You belong to me.” [crowd cheers and applauds] “Remember when you used to say your grace before you ate your food?” “You belong to me.” “Remember when you played the piano for the church?” “When’s the last time you been to church, my n*gga?” [audience exclaims] [man] Mm. [woman] Mm! But I shot back, “God, I get it.” “But the crime don’t fit the punishment.” [crowd laughs] “The crime don’t fit… I’m serious!” “This is too much on me. I’m still down here. I’m gregarious.” “I’m makin’ people laugh, making ’em have fun.” I said, “But look, what this is doin’ to my family, God.” I said, “Look what it’s doing to my kids.” And you know what he said? “You see what they did to my kid?” [audience exclaims] [applause] [woman] Heavy. I gave you two beautiful daughters. [man] Amen. That was my only… begotten son. [scattered applause] And then I said, “Man, why you bringing up old shit?” [audience laughs] As soon as I said it, I got dizzy. I said, “Okay, okay!” “G, come on, man! Come on. Knock it off, bro.” “C’mon, my n*gga. I’m just…” “Bro, I’m a kidder!” [chuckles] “Bro, I’m joking. Come one, man.” “Let me out this bitch. Come on, bro.” “I’m fuckin’ around, bro.” “Okay. I didn’t mean to say ‘fuckin’.” I’m foolin’.” “Just let up off me.” [audience laughing] And finally, it came to me. It’s about blessings. [woman 1] Yes. [woman 2] Right. God blessed me with this talent. [man] Amen. He blessed me with all this money and this fame. And when I forgot about God… [woman 3] Mm! …he blessed me with a stroke.

That’s what really got me at one point. I went from Jamie motherfuckin’ Foxx to, “Okay, lean over.” [crowd laughs] “Okay, we’re gonna go in there.” I said, “Damn, y’all gotta go all the way?” Damn, this is… Oh, this is fucked. Ugh. I can’t wipe my own booty… Ass. [inhales sharply] I lost everything. But the only thing I could hold onto was… was my sense of humor. I never let that go. I couldn’t necessarily walk that good. I couldn’t talk that good. But I… But I didn’t let go of my funny. I said, “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” “If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.” So I was always crackin’ jokes to the point to where the nurses thought I was really losin’ my mind. And I was never myself. Never myself. ‘Cause it’s a wellness check, they ask you who you are. For five days, I was Denzel Washington. I was Denzel. [as Denzel] “All right.” [chuckles] “All right, so that’s what you’re tellin’ me. Okay.” “All right.” [chuckles] “You gotta wipe my ass, huh? Okay.” “All right. Okay.” “That’s what you’re telling me.

I said, ‘Impossible.'” “They said, ‘Are you mad?’ I said, ‘No.'” “And then they said I need a bedpan.” “And I said, ‘I don’t do bedpans.'” “Because I’m Jay-Z.” [chuckles timidly] “And then I shit all over myself.” [audience laughs] [Jamie] “I said, ‘Oh, shit.” “I think I need a bedpan.” If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.

[imitates monitor beeping] They said, “We’re gonna lose him.” So it was a 13-or 14-day period where he says, “We gotta keep him calm.” “And we’ve given him every medication. It’s not workin’.” “We have to keep him calm.” “His vitals are so high, we’re gonna lose him.” You know what the worst thing to have when you tryin’ to stay calm in a hospital room? Black family members. [audience laughs] Aka, n*ggas. ‘Cause you know they come in with, “Oh, Lord!” “Good God Almighty!” “Not my baby! Not now! Not now!” [alert beeps] “Ooh, good God Almighty! Please save him, Jesus!” My Black family was goin’ so crazy, my white doctor said, “Hey, we need to keep these n*ggas outta here so he can stay alive.” I’m jokin’. He didn’t say that. Now, you know if I was to say that, that’s what TMZ would report. [imitates news fanfare] [imitating TMZ announcer] “Jamie Foxx said his white doctor had to call him ‘n*gga’ in order to stay alive.” That’s not what happened. [audience laughs] Yeah. All right? He actually said, “Get these Black motherfuckers outta here.” No, I’m kidding. But it was real. My vitals were so bad, they were gonna lose me. And… that’s when a miracle happened, and that miracle was working through my youngest daughter. She’s 14. I didn’t want her to see me like that. But she snuck into my hospital room with her guitar. [crowd] Aww. And she says, “I know what my daddy needs.” [breathing shakily] She said, “That’s my daddy.” What’s interesting is my daughter used to carry her guitar all the time with her. And they said, when she was playing, my vitals… went down. The nurses at the nurses’ station were baffled. Like, “Wow, what did they give him?” So they rushed into the room, and she said, “Shh.” [softly] I got him. My daughter used to carry that guitar when she was ten years old. She would carry it everywhere. She carried it everywhere. I was like, “You gonna carry a guitar?” Going to Disneyland, she got that guitar. [crowd laughs] We going to a football game, she got that guitar. Everywhere we went, she had the guitar. But you know what I found out? It was God in that guitar. [women] Yes.

I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, n*gga.” “I pray for you, partner.” “I prayed expeditiously for you, n*gga.” [audience laughing] But every time I run into somebody, I cry. I ran into T.I., I cried. I ran into Candice Parker, I cried. Then, somehow, I ran into Halle Berry. [audience exclaims] I didn’t cry as much. [crowd laughs] ‘Cause Halle just rushed me and hugged me so tight. I was like, “Ooh, Lord, have mercy, Jesus.” “This here is Halle Berry.” And she don’t realize how fucking sexy she is. And I don’t want to blow the moment ’cause it was heartfelt. She said, “Jamie, oh my God!” And she hugged me. I said, “Ooh, oh, my gosh.” She said, “There’s so much I wanted to tell you.” And I said, “There’s so much I gotta tell you!” ‘Cause she was huggin’ me. I’m like, “Oh my God.” “Please don’t let me disrespect this moment.” So I had to relay… ‘Cause the hug was so nice, I had to relay to my pickle. “Hey, stand down, n*gga. This ain’t that kind of hug.” He shot back, “Shit!” [audience laughs] “N*gga, that’s Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” “Halle Berry! Halle Berry!” I’m like, “Man, don’t blow this for me, my n*gga. She’ll feel it!” “Please!” And she’s holding me. She’s talkin’ to me, this close to my ear. I said, “Goddamn!” She right here in my ear. I said, “Damn!” Know how women pretty like that always have a fragrance you’ve never smelled. That shit… I said… [sniffs] “Ooh, what the fuck is that?” “God, this smells like Heaven.” I said… [inhales] I took that shit in, and she was hugging me. I said, “Oh, God, please. Please stay with me, Lord. Please.” “Don’t let me fuck this moment up.” She hugged, and then she… As I tried to pull away, she hugged tighter. Oof. I said, “Good God Almighty.” [crowd laughs] And I could feel my hips. I said, “Hips! Hips, stop! Stop!” But I did just clench up to let her know I’m there. [crowd laughs] So she’s huggin’ me, and I’m trying to get out of this moment, and as I’m trying to push away from her heartfelt sexual grip, I tried to push away, know what she did? She kissed me on my neck. [crowd exclaims] And n*gga, I came… [crowd exclaims] …to my senses! [crowd laughing] You nasty motherfuckers. Yo, man, I ain’t finna come like that with Halle. And as she was huggin’ me, “Oh my God, thank you so much.” So Halle, when you see this, please understand what I’m sayin’. You just so beautiful. That’s all we wanna say. Halle you’re beautiful. So she let me go. She let me out of her clutches. I said, “Thank you, Jesus!” But then, I felt a rumblin’. I felt something rumbling. I said, “Ooh, whee!” “I can’t wait.” So I rushed to the bathroom to see what was rumblin’. And I pulled my pants down, and I said, “Oh, shit!” “Somebody back!” [laughs] “Somebody back!” And then I ask him, “Hey, n*gga, what got into you?” Know what he said? “Sometimes, you gotta pop out and show n*ggas.” [intense beat playing] ♪ We back!

Man… We were waiting for you. I’m happy you’re here. I’m happy all of you are here. I have so much to tell you. You’re comfortable? You can talk back to me. I want you guys to feel that. This only works if we feel like family. I know the camera’s here and it’s a whole thing. It’s a big night, it’s a lot of pressure. That kinda thing, you know? I want you guys to feel as comfortable as I hope to be. We got a lot of shit to talk about. I’m happy you’re here. I need you. I wanna talk about secrets! Secrets! I should whisper it, right? I carried a lot of secrets my whole life. I feel like I was birthed into them. One of my biggest, one of my last held secrets is my name. My name is not Jerrod. Welcome to the show, everybody. I thought we were being honest tonight. Jerrod’s my middle name. I was given the name Jerrod by my brother, Joe. He’s, like, seven years older than me. They just trusted a kid to name a kid, but whatever. I’m thankful for that. Without him I’d have to go by my real name, my first name, which we don’t talk about. It is not good. I don’t like it. I’ve always hated that name, no one calls me that except for my mom. My dad named me… He combined his dad’s first name and my mom’s dad’s first name and mushed them together. Not to make something elegant, like William Edward or something like that. It’s more like Toyotathon. I hate that name. I’ve hidden that name my whole life. I used to get it removed from the yearbook. Every year in high school I would bribe somebody. It’d cost me 20 dollars to get my first name taken out of it. I never let people see my driver’s license. I had it taken off my bank cards. I’ve always been ashamed of it. I’ve always hidden it. And it’s funny because it’s a name given to me to honor two people. It’s supposed to be this gift to both my granddads. And it almost seemed kind of fucked up that I hide that, that I like tuck it away, but that’s because you don’t know my grandfathers. If you knew them, you’d know keeping a secret is the only way to honor them. That’s kind of who they were. They were granddads. I’m named after two men who most of their lives, most of their sex lives at least were secrets. My mom’s dad had four kids with my mom’s mom, his wife, and four kids outside of that marriage, just kind',\n",
              "  'of scattered about. My dad’s dad had five kids with his wife and about 23 outside of the marriage. Yeah. I come from a long line of cool n*ggers. 23. Dillon, South Carolina. Jim Gowens is his name. We don’t have the same last name because my dad was an outside kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There’s no easy way to say your grandma was a side piece. I wanna say it was something else. They’d prefer I used terms like “affair” and whatever, but nah, that’s not what it was. She was fuckin’ a married n*gger and that’s just… So my grandma had three kids by a married man, my uncle Pete, my dad, my aunt Nell, and his wife found out and confronted my grandma about it. I like to think it was on some “Color Purple” shit, like she crossed the field or whatever. But she confronted my grandma and demanded that she stop sleeping with her man, and my grandma fucked him again and had my Aunt Cat. I think she’s where I get my ambition from. My aunt Cat is proud of that, by the way. She’ll tell everybody her origin story. She’s like: “Don’t nobody tell me who to sleep with.” “And then she fucked him again and had me out of spite.” “That’s me, I’m the spite baby.” She loves that shit. But we don’t really talk about it. We don’t really talk about it. My dad doesn’t really know his dad, but he still felt enough pride to name me after him. My mom’s dad was also like a cheater, but she lived in the house that he was cheating from. And so when you’re that family, you learn not to say shit. My mom, I guess, learned from her mom. I’m trying to paint a picture of a world before Destiny’s Child, where women got cheated on and it didn’t play out like a Terry McMillan novel. It was much more quiet than that. They just kind of existed with the secret. They knew, but they didn’t know. It’s weird, it’s like generations of that, generations of just seeing things, not seeing things. I saw my parents’ sex tape. This is kind of a side tangent. I was about twelve years old. I came home from school early. I would watch my dad… If you got a dad or an older brother, they might’ve had a porn stash. This was the ’90s. My dad kept his tapes in a Nike box in the bedroom closet on the top shelf, beside a gun and a jar of nickels. And I remember putting this tape in, and it was about 15 seconds before I started recognizing the bedroom. I know those sheets, they got lemons on them. But that’s the thing, I never told my family. I never told my parents that I’d seen that. It’s odd because it’s one of those things… You can’t talk about sex with your parents, not that anybody really wants to, but you just can’t. And you’re only here because your parents fucked, isn’t that kinda funny? Your dad came in your mom and you’re here. Have you ever been watching a movie with your parents and a sex scene came on and you just',\n",
              "  'gotta be, like, “nope, no it’s not”. Things that exist, but don’t exist. It’s things that are right there, hiding in plain sight. My father had me and my brother with my mom, and then he had four kids with a bitch named Raneta. It’s not that I hate her name. It’s just that it sounds like a villain in a Tyler Perry movie. And other kids, he had other kids. My dad was, he was really out there, man. He was really, really out there. And I knew about it since I was a kid. It was a small town, and it’s a secret that he thought he was keeping from the family. He thought he was doing a good job keeping the secret. But I found out. I never told him that I knew. My brother found out. He didn’t tell him. It’s funny to live in a house with someone knowing who they are, knowing that they’re cheating on your mom and not saying anything to him. He used to go out on Friday nights, he would say he was going to work. My dad is a truck driver, which by the way, if you’re cheating on your wife and you’re looking for a profession that allows just long blackout dates, get your CDLs and hit the road. I really recommend it. He would say he was going to a second job on Friday nights, but he would get dressed up, and I mean dressed up by North Carolina dad standards. He tucked his t-shirt into his jeans. He would say he was going to work with cologne on. Do you understand what I’m saying? It’s just, like, a liar. And it would just leave me as a kid knowing that… It’s weird to know it, to know, to really, really know, and not say anything. I was scared. I didn’t know what to say. I don’t know what I could’ve done. I don’t know if I would’ve said anything if I had the courage, because I only saw this secret as something that could’ve torn our family apart. If my mom found out, I thought it would be over. He was fucking my homeboy TJ’s aunt. This was this story TJ told me about, and that’s hard because TJ, he didn’t want to snitch. In the hood… I didn’t wanna snitch! He told me, he was like: “Man, I came home from school the other day” “and I went to my aunt’s house” “and your pop was just there on the couch.” What? He’s like: “Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was just on the couch.” He saw my dad sitting on the couch. He walks in, he’s excited to see my dad. He knows my dad very well, they used to play Madden together. He knows him. He’s like: “Mr. Carmichael, what are you doing here?” And my dad, being caught, under pressure, you know what he did? He just squinted his eyes and pretended he was somebody else. I don’t know how that was supposed to work. He literally was just like: “Mr. Carmichael? I don’t know who you’re talking about.” He just grabbed his shit and got the fuck outta there. My father. And TJ was there with his aunt and he said:',\n",
              "  '“Do you know who that was?” “That’s my best friend’s dad. That’s Joe Carmichael.” And she said: “Joe Carmichael?” “He told me his name was Jerry Rice.” That’s right, that’s right. My father was telling bitches his name was Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice. Do you know how absurd that is? And I got so many questions, things he won’t talk about. Did you say it? Did you act surprised? “Did you go: What? There’s another Jerry Rice?” Was it all part of the game? Did he go: “Yeah, my name is Jerry Rice. I know. I get it all the time.” How did he react? He was a wild man, he was really out there, really, really out there, just holding it in, just holding it all in. He had a double or triple bypass surgery, I guess that’s where it went. It’s fine. I’m paying for his health insurance. Don’t groan for the man. I’m keeping him alive right now. I made him tell my mom. It became too much. It’s a secret that I think I was happy keeping as a child because I thought it made sense for the family, but then it was embarrassing, first of all. Because people knew. It seems like everyone knew, but my mom, and that’s really tough because my mom is a very sweet, loving, trusting, Christian, God-fearing woman, who was just standing by her man, trusting her husband. And my dad was just, you know, he was really out there. I got really drunk in London and I was like: “It’s time.” “I’m gonna confront him about it.” And it’s hard. This was hard because this is a tough man. Again, he kept a sawed-off shotgun in the closet by the porn, and it’s not easy. It’s not easy. I was really afraid, but I remember starting the call saying: “Listen, this will all go well as long as you don’t lie to me.” And I was just almost in tears and just so emotional. “I know about everything, man. I know about Renita,” “and the kids, and the blah blah blah,.” You know what he said? He actually said: “I always knew you’d be the one.” That’s what he said. He knew. So I made him tell my mom. He waited until I was back home in North Carolina to tell her, fucking pussy. I know, that’s a pussy thing to do, right? He waited. He needed the support. He waited until I was home. And this was his big plan to tell my mom. He was like: “Okay, so you and your brother, you take her out to dinner.” “I’m gonna stay home. And then you bring her back from dinner.” “You drop her off, she’ll come in the house, and then I’m gonna tell her.” And I was like: “Okay, you want me to hide a gun behind the toilet, too?” “What kinda Godfather plan is this?” But I went along with it. It took a lot for him. That dinner was the worst dinner I’ve ever had in my entire life. I took my mom to a hibachi restaurant. Earlier that day, I had taken my nieces to see the “Trolls” movie. I love going to the movies with my nieces.',\n",
              "  'It’s the best. They’re not my kids so I can just get high and do fun shit with them, it’s the best. And we’d seen the “Trolls” movie, and I don’t know if you’ve seen it, spoiler alert. The premise is that these are these colorful trolls that are singing and all types of shit, and if something devastating happens to them, they lose all of their color. I remember thinking that the whole dinner, that whole night is just looking at my mom, just looking in her eyes going: “She’s going to lose her color.” It was really, really scary. Mind you, all of this happened at a hibachi grill, so I’m looking in her eyes, but there’s a flame and we gotta clap every couple minutes. He’s juggling salt and pepper shakers. “Yay, okay. My mom is about to be fucking destroyed,” “but this is a great trick.” I get mad when I don’t get a Japanese chef. Sometimes they’re Mexican and they’re just passing them off as… Anyway. How many Japanese chefs are there in North Carolina? I’m piecing this together now. I brought her home. I dropped her off. I went to my brother’s house, and we waited by the phone very, very anxiously, me, my brother, and sister-in-law just waited, very nervous. And then my mom called. I could hear in her voice that she’d been crying. And I’ll never forget, her first words were: “I’m okay.” And he told her, begged for her forgiveness. She forgave him, she stayed. It’s kinda anti-climactic, I know. She actually made him breakfast the next morning. I’ll never forget that fact. And mostly because it’s an embarrassing fact to admit. It’s not how I thought the story would play out. It’s somehow worse. But it was out in the open. And once that was done, I was left alone feeling like a liar because I had a secret, one that I kept from my mother, and my father, and my family, my friends, and you, all of you, professionally, personally. And the secret is that I’m gay. Thank you for that. We love you. That’s very sweet. I really appreciate that. It means a lot. And I’m accepting the love, I really appreciate the love. My, kind of, ego wants to rebel against it, you clap and you’re very sweet and you’re very kind, and I appreciate it. Part of me wants to be like: “I’m fucking gay.” “I’m not fucking retarded.” Because I can feel it, bro. I can feel it. There’s a lot that happens coming out. I’m telling you guys and I see the Yankee fitteds. Some of y’all are just like: “Shit, we at a gay show, bro?” This is for HBO. You know how many n*ggers just turned the TV off saying to their girl right now “we gotta watch something else”? Like, y’all clapped. A lot of you clapped and you felt it. Some of you didn’t really wanna clap. You were just like: “We gotta do that shit. We’re in New York and there’s cameras.” That’s okay, I get it. I came out to my friends. We love you. I wanna accept that, you know? It feels like I didn’t earn it. It’s like, what did I do, suck',\n",
              "  'a Dominican dude’s dick? And then y’all clapped for that, you know? Because I rebelled against that. I really did, bro, I rebelled against it my whole life. I never thought I’d come out. I didn’t think I’d ever, ever, ever come out. Probably at many points in my life I thought I’d rather die than confront the truth of that. I didn’t actually say it to people, because I know it changes people’s, some people, it changes their perception of me. I can’t control that. I’m from an environment where I was, kind of, raised to be a man, whatever that means. Didn’t expect gay babies, you know what I’m saying? You don’t see old ladies looking at a toddler being, like: “Look at his cheeks. I bet he’s gonna be a top.” “Get that baby some prep now.” I feel you, bro. I’m with you. I’m from the hood. Sometimes I’ll be in the shower like: “N*gger, I’m really gay. Fuck, dude!” You know? Shit is shocking to me, too. I didn’t know. It’s fucked up all my relationships. I had a boyfriend, me and that n*gga talked to each other like men. We’d say shit like: “I wanna suck your dick, bro.” None of that gay shit over here. Sometimes we’re making out and just whispering “no homo” to each other. Just tonguing that n*gger down being, like, “pause”. I feel you. I got mostly straight friends. Them n*ggers didn’t wanna hear that shit. My homeboy, Jamar, said… This is one of my best friends. I let him sleep on my couch when he needed it. I was always there for him. He told me he felt like he was tricked into having a gay best friend. He said: “I would’ve never signed up for this.” And I said: “N*gger, you owe me 85000 dollars.” Gotta accept the love, man. I need the love. I need it. I was really out here lying, though. That’s the thing, I came out too late, a little too late. That “it gets better shit is for the kids”. That’s not for an adult man figuring himself out. They don’t want that. Nobody wants that shit. All my friends felt like I was just duplicitous, like I was just lying to them. They didn’t know who I was. They all reacted like Sally Field in Mrs. Doubtfire. They were like: “The whole time?” They were very mad about that shit. It cleared up my relationship with all my black homegirls. My friend Ashley told me before I came out she could sense it. She was like: “Please just tell me you’re gay so this all makes sense.” I guess there are only so many times you can Facetime a woman to see if your outfit looks okay before they start having some questions. They were the toughest. Black women were the toughest people to come out to, but also the most supportive. I’m very, very thankful for all of the black ladies in my life who have supported me through that, through all of it, all of it. They’re not homophobic at all. They’re racist as a motherfucker. They don’t like that I had a white boyfriend. See? You see what I’m saying? You see that change? You can',\n",
              "  'be gay, but n*gger, what? You date white boys, really? Is that a shock? Surprise, surprise. No more secrets. I’m gonna tell you all. You heard her say “wow”? That’s the sound of a Black woman that feels doubly betrayed. My sister is on that shit, too. Listen, I’m used to it. I grew up just in the hood on some real strong masculine shit. It plays out. Look, I’ll say this, I actually think that it is important to say this, I believe in the black family. I think that black men should marry black women, and have black babies and raise them to be smart, just good citizens, educated. I think that’s very, very important. A hundred percent. I think gay black men should be able to fuck whoever the fuck we want. What is the consequence? There are no black babies coming from the kind of sex I have, okay? It’s all getting flushed. It doesn’t matter. Doesn’t matter. The black girls, they try. I would send them pictures of my boyfriend and they would ignore that he’s white. They would just be like… I remember I sent a picture to my homegirl Tiffany and she was like: “He got some pretty glasses.” I was like: “Nah, bitch, it’s not the glasses.” “Look at the skin of my vanilla king.” I didn’t call him that. I’m hiding nothing from you guys. But your name. Now you guys are too much like my family. Let’s go back to the audience-performer relationship we had before. It’s a lot. I’m really happy we had this moment of… My brother texted me earlier today and said: “I’m missing my first special taping,” “but I know it’s necessary. I love you.” That’s very sweet. I love him. He’s there for me as much as he can be. He tries. He tries and I love him. I love him a lot. I love Joe so much. He’s all I got in a lot of this. I wish he’d try harder. I’m probably a little mad at him, a little bit mad. He’s my big brother, he’s supposed to protect me. He loves me despite, that’s the thing. It’s a little condescending, you know? It’s love with an asterisk. “I don’t really fuck with the gay shit, but I still love you.” That’s that masculine shit. I could feel the distance between us. And I hate that because no one would want that. It makes me feel unwanted. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. It’s like he’s looking down on me and accepting me despite. It’s especially hurtful just because I make so much more money than this n*gger. It’s not even close. I don’t wanna be gross and talk about money, but the difference is millions and millions of dollars. I love my brother a lot. He’s a nice guy. Nice as… I’m saying that. He has five kids who I love a lot, a lot. My nieces mean a lot to me. My oldest niece, Joliette, she’s fourteen now and I like talking to her. I think she’s so smart and she’s really beautiful. Her face reminds me of my mom’s. I have a five-year-old niece and then four-year-old twin nieces and I love them. I',\n",
              "  'like spending time with them because I’m not hiding anything when I’m with them, I’m just with them. We’re just there playing. We’re just eating ice cream or they’re trying to braid my hair. They are easy to talk about it with, you know? Joliette, there’s no pre-tense. It’s harder with the older ones. I came out to my dad again. I say again, cause he forgets. It’s cognitive dissonance. I have to remind him. I have to re-up every so often. There’s a part of him that likes that I came out. I don’t think he necessarily wants a gay son, but he likes that me coming out takes some of the heat off him. Like when he first found out he was like “no, it’s cool”, “I fucked up, you fucked up”. “You gay, I did what I did… Que sera…” My father’s dream is that I’m bi. That’s all he wants. That’s all he wants, the hope, somewhere on the horizon, that I’m still getting pussy. That’s all he wants. He’s probably actually disappointed in both of me and my brother. He’s probably looking at us like: “Wait, so you gay and you only fuck your wife?” “What kinda nerds am I raising here?” I told my dad, I said: “I know two things for a fact.” “I will never be an astronaut and I’m a gay man.” And you know what my father said? He said: “Don’t give up on the moon, son.” I hid it from my mom for the most part. I was afraid that her reaction would be to just go inside with it. I love her a lot. I love her dearly. And I’m trying to describe her without sounding cliché and describe the love that I have for her. I really feel like I was one of her closest friends. I feel like I have always looked out for her. I remember on the call, the last time I talked about being gay with my Mom, she said: “I can’t go against Jesus.” And it just bothers me. I get it, cause she’s… She’s doing the best she can. I think. She’s trying to accept. I don’t know what she’s trying to do. I think she’s trying to accept it. Part of me knows she’s at home trying to pray the gay away. I get a little mad sometimes. Any time I don’t match with a dude on RIA I’m like: “I bet that bitch over there praying to God.” I feel it too. It fucks with me because this is a religion that I still believe in. I’m still a Christian and it’s taken a lot, it’s taken a whole lot because I’ve had to reconfigure God and what God is and what he means in order to accept myself. I had to kind of rebuild. And with my mom… I’m sorry. A lot of it is not really… It’s kinda happening in real time, so it’s not totally worked out. Forgive me. I think she’s… She thinks not reacting is the best reaction. I think she’s been rewarded for staying quiet, you know? It’s like with her dad, so she gives me nothing. Even hate starts to feel like love because that’s acknowledgement. It’s not just nice.',\n",
              "  'It’s not pleasant, it’s real and that feels… I think that would feel better. I wish she would yell at me. I wish she would tell me to not come home. I wish she’d call me a f*ggot like my Uncle June Bug did. Yeah. It hurt my feelings, but I was like: “N*gga, your name June Bug.” I’d rather get called a f*ggot than June Bug. Anything, anything, anything. She’s nice. She’s sweet. She ignores it. The worst of her is cold, like really, really cold. I mean she’s a nice lady, but like, there’s a part of her that’s really… She can shut people out. She can ignore, she can block and like, go inside. But you gave yourself so many years. Why don’t you give her that time? I’d love to give her all the time in the world, you know? I don’t know how much time it would take. I don’t know how much time we have left. Just in general, one of my biggest fears is my parents funeral, just the thought of one them dying without saying everything, without contending, without expressing it all. And my mom’s in her early sixties and she has time and she’s… I also just don’t know if that’s when people change. They do. Maybe. I don’t know. It sounds like a joke, but like part of me feels like if I ask my mom to change this much about her is like, you ever see a 90-year-old get a college degree? On the news… And you’re like: “Bitch, now?” “Good luck in the fucking job market.” It’s not that I don’t find hope for change, but I think even if she was young, there’s a part of my mom that’s very, very cold. I know it because I have it, I can be that. That’s why my last real secret is that I’m… People think I’m nice. Nah, I’m like my Mom. Fuck everybody. Very selfish. Very, very, very, very selfish. I smile. Very polite about it. I lie to everybody face. “Yeah, we should get dinner!” You know, lies. How you lie to people? I’m afraid of not… Man, just like my Mom, is that performance of like who you’re supposed to be. Like I’m afraid of not smiling. I smile a lot. I feel like if I don’t smile, I look like the n*ggers that shot Malcom X. I know. I’m afraid of things getting awkward. Like weird. Like even this moment, I’m like “man, I should probably think of a joke”. Shit is falling apart out here. Do you wish you didn’t tell her? No, no. I stayed in the closet for a long time. I think because of my mom I felt like… It’s not like I could bring a dude home to her, so what’s the point? But as much as she believes in God, I believe in personal growth and feeling free. I feel freer. We say things like: “Sometimes you grow and you gotta leave people behind.” “People are in your life for a reason or a season.” Or these kinds of cliché sayings. It’s hard when that person is your mom. You think a lot of the guilt is your dad’s guilt? I carry some guilt. I think',\n",
              "  'because I was complicit in the lie, I guess. I thought I was protecting her. I always felt like my mom’s protector. I always felt like… I’m trying to explain this concept. I always felt like… I always felt like the result of her prayers. My mom, one of her favorite Bible verses is, I think it’s Jeremiah Chapter 33: “Ask me and I will tell you things you don’t know and can’t find out.” Do you think without your mom’s approval you’ll be okay? That eventually this will be something that you’ll be okay with? I think without my mom’s approval… I’d like to believe I will be okay. I think I’ve spent a lot of time trying to supplement that love and I’m very thankful because I have some very, very good friends. Really, really good people who are there… I think it’s something that I kind of search for. When there’s distance between me and my mom, it’s the times I feel the most like an orphan. I feel abandoned. I’m sorry, that laugh was fake. I’m trying to make jokes. I wish this moment weren’t so weird, man. I think like, what do I want from her? I know she’ll see this. I don’t know what will happen. You guys got any ideas? I don’t know what else to… I’ve been trying to be very honest because my whole life was shrouded in secrets. And I figured the only route I haven’t tried was the truth, so I’m saying everything. Here’s everything. I feel okay. I’m very thankful for tonight. Rothaniel. My name’s Rothaniel. Goodnight, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.

[Car horn honks] [Audience cheering] [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Jim Jefferies! [Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that’s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I’m at the end of the tour right now. I’m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So… [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she’s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and I’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and I don’t see it getting better. Um… I’ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “Oh, I used to party with Madonna.” And I went, “You fucking what, when?” And she went, “I used to party with Madonna.” Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I’m not bragging. I didn’t get the model years. I didn’t get those years. I’ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um… So, I said, “So you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” And she went, “No, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” I go, “You need to elaborate on this story right now.” And she goes, “Oh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.” As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, “That’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” That’s a big one. “That’s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.” So she said, “I used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna’s house.” And she goes, “This one time, the four of us were over at Madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” And then I went, “Shut the fuck up!” And she went, “What?” I said, “I know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! You all started fucking each other!” And she went, “We did. We started…” “Just shut up!” And she goes, “What do you care for?” I said, “You’re the mother of my child! I don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ NBA player while you’re licking out Madonna’s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…” [Moaning] And she goes, “Oh, you’re being silly. What do you care for? You’ve partied way more than I have in my life.” And I went, “That is not true. I’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn’t call it a party.” For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It’s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We’re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, “Well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.” [Chuckles] I don’t… You know, I’ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I’ve had good nights out, but I’ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? I’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It’s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just… They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they’re going, “No, dude. Use the table. Don’t use your…” And I go, “Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um…” And it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring ’em in like, “Huh?” And you can do this. You can go… “Uh…” Like that. And they’ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.” When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.” And that’s a vastly different emotion that… I don’t think women will never… Yeah, okay. This is the thing. In America, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to,',\n",
              "  'I don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “And still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” And of course, that’s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like… a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don’t actually mean, but this is something I’m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I’m sorry. I… [Audience whooping] I’m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. I’m sure they do. I’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. What I’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now… I’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “Oh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.” And don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. Right? We do. But there’s little things in society that you can’t change. Men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. There’s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine’s Day is just for women. They say it’s for romantics. They say it’s for couples or something like that. It’s just for women. There’s no man who gets excited by Valentine’s Day. There’s no man that when he sees the Valentine’s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “Oh, Valentine’s Day is coming!” Valentine’s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “How much money do I have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” It doesn’t stop there. Mother’s Day! Mother’s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend’s first Mother’s Day. And she went, “Oh, I wonder what I’ll get for Mother’s Day.” And I went, “Probably fucking nothing. He’s got no money. He’s six months old. What do you think he’s gonna buy you?” Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother’s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause I assumed that’s what Hank would have wanted her to have… and I wrote a card. I’m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I’m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] “Happy Mother’s Day. Love, Hank.” And I went, “H-A-N…” And then I did the “K” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. See, now I know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “Well, fathers have Father’s Day.” Father’s Day is bullshit. It’s fucking shit, Father’s Day. Father’s Day came around and my girlfriend went, “What do you want for Father’s Day?” And I went, “I don’t want anything. Don’t even worry about it. I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on. You gotta have something.” I said, “Honestly, I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on.” And I went, “It’s my fucking money. Just don’t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.” That’s why every single father has that one Father’s Day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! It’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “I heart Dad.” And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go… “That cost me nothing, that mug.” [Audience whooping] See… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I’ve got it, right? April 18th… Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It’s good, isn’t it? Everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It’s nice. A month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “Oh, the decorations are up!” [Men whooping] And it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine’s Day when they don’t get a gift. You could go like, “Oh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. They’ve, uh…” I’m thinking, I don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I’m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting “Jim Jefferies” on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, “April 18th.” ‘Cause it’s good, right? You’re in a bar. You’re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go… Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt. The weird thing is I’m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I’m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it’s a much more… I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex… Oh, you know… I do it. I get involved, ’cause I feel like I have to. You know, I… But I’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh… When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… But the thing is, you can’t smell porn. You don’t smell porn. You just… You just watch it. They never… And it’s different, porn. It’s different. They clean the girl’s asshole. They pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. I’m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She’s like… You’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “Put it in my ass.” She’s inviting. It’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. And then she’s like… She says things… I don’t know, things like, “I’m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.” And… And the experience I’ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I’ve… My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although',\n",
              "  'that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… It’s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “I’m gonna act like I enjoy it.” She does that whole, “Yeah. Oh, no, that’s good.” [Moaning] Ahh! ♪ I’m having a good time ♪ And then they’re always going, “Are you done? Are you close to done?” You never fuck a pussy and they go, “Are you almost done? Finish this.” Like that. If you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don’t know how much they get paid. I’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. It’s the opposite bit of society. Um… But they do a thing called “ATM.” I don’t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for “ass to mouth.” That’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “I love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.” And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work… [Applause] she’s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. Now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “Well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?” [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering] So… I’m a father. Um… I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. He’s a good little boy. No, he’s a great little fella. I really like him. Um… My girlfriend super loves him, though. It’s fucking creepy. And… I’m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn’t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn’t fuck it. I… I just don’t get along with women. You know how it is. I don’t want them in my house, and… So… Because you dream, see… For example, okay? When Hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “Aw, that’s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.” That’s what I think… ‘Cause that’s what I think about my son. I hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. I don’t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “Oh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you’re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” Right, you know… And it’s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. They’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it’s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “Uh, uh!” Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, “Everyone, my boyfriend’s here. Here’s my boyfriend. Give him here. He’s my boyfriend.” And then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ It’s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl… Let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “Hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. Give her here. Give her here. She’s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She’s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don’t worry about a thing.” [Applause] [Cheering] So… Also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It’s just little things. Even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. There’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. I don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. ‘Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don’t give a shit. Fucking… My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I’ve got shit on my dick, I’ll ring me mate Jason up and go, “Hey, Jason… It’s happened again. I got shit on my dick.” And he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “Oh,',\n",
              "  'I can’t wait to call Karen.” [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you… When my girlfriend got pregnant… When you meet… When you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like, “It is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.” And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “You’re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It’s over. You’re not gonna sleep.” They’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I’ve had girlfriends. That’s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “Fuck it! Let’s have a kid.” Fucking did it, right? These other people, man… You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “We’re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?” And you wanna say, “No, you’re really boring and we hate you.” But you go, “Oh, okay, great. You’re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.” And… And then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “We have to see how our careers are going and shit.” And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “From our family to yours.” And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “What the fuck is this shit?” And they’re like, “We had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.” And you go, “Well, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control…” And then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “What’s happening? A new person.” And they’re like, “Fuck off. We don’t love you anymore. We’re going.” And they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you’re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I’m not saying ’cause they look the same. I’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going… “Yolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.” [Jeffries chuckles] I’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh… Gun control. Now… No, wait. Before you… Don’t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, “Yeah! Do it, Jim!” No, let’s just… [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I’m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the… Oh, it doesn’t matter. I don’t like guns, right? I’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn’t been beaten. And… Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. I don’t know how or why this happened, uh… Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, “That’s it! No more guns!” And we all went, “Yeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.” Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “Maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my guns!” [Whooping] So, here’s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It’s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “Fuck off. I like guns.” It’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. And there’s nothing wrong with it. There’s nothing wrong with saying, “I like something. Don’t take it away from me.” But don’t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] “I need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.” Really? Is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? Is it? I’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, “Well, that’d never happen to me.” You don’t know that, because you know what? ♪ From time to time We all get sad ♪ ♪ One day you’re happy Then you’re sad ♪ ♪ And then, uh-oh ♪ Protection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent]',\n",
              "  \"“Well, imagine if you had a gun.” And I’m like, “All right. I was naked at the time. I wasn’t wearing my holster. I wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.” What world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready? You have guns ’cause you like guns! That’s why you go to gun conventions! That’s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “Fucking yeah!” Like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, “That’d never happen in my house ’cause I’m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.” Then they’re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you’re like, “Wait there, fuck-face! Oh! You’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I’m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother’s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother’s birthday? Maybe if you didn’t leave the window open [In whining voice] ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, “None of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” I… I think they’re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] “Oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” And then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “You’re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.” Then she’d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “Why don’t they like me?” Let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, “Oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” They go, “We’ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.” Yeah, that’ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and… [Mimicking machine gun] And you’ve got Kevin. Now, I’m sure Kevin’s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don’t agree with me. Don’t think I don’t. Out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They’re looking around, going, “Wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” And then… there’s the last 10%. And they’re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. Just… And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I’m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “If you don’t like it, go home! If you don’t like it, go home!” And my answer to that is, “No.” I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I’ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And… unless you’re an American Indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It’s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don’t know what it says. I’ve never seen it. If there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. And don’t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had… Fucking, I get it, right? I’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I’m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] “You cannot change the Second Amendment!” And I’m like, “Yes, you can. It’s called an ‘amendment.'” If you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don’t think your constitution is set in stone. You’ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, “Hey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let’s get that one out. Let’s get that one out.” You used to have this other thing in America called, uh… slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, “That’s it. No more slaves!” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my slaves!” And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “Why should I have my slaves taken off me? I’m a responsible slave owner. I’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I… I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!” That’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns\",\n",
              "  'taken off me? I’ve done nothing wrong.” Look, I agree with you. If you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that’s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! “Oh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.” Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can’t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “Thanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” See, that’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me, I’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” Who’s to say you’re not crazy? That’s the thing about crazy people. They don’t know they’re crazy. That’s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, “I think, therefore I am.” You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that’s it. Right now, I think I’m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That’s what I think I’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] “I hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.” [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, “Well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It’ll be delivered to your house. That’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. You’ve got $34,000. You’re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger’s as fuck. Right? I don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] “Guns! Who wants to sell me a gun?” Now, I’m gonna wrap this up. We won’t talk about it anymore. Now… See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with… That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. – [Audience cheering] – Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You’re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I’m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets… Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what’s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “Fuck you, buddy! Ah, you’re not a bad guy. You’re all right.” Now… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause I don’t behave myself in there, so I’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘Cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like… Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That’s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “Hey, ladies. He’s a fireman.” And he comes out with his hose and like that… And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “You can’t take care of your kids.” It’s… And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don’t know… I don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. There’s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… That’s what a private “dance” is, right? I don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can’t imagine that there would be. I don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… She goes, “How was it?” And she goes, “Well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.” So Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. It was… I’m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn’t… Now… The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about',\n",
              "  'having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He’s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now… the great thing about DJ is… he already looks disabled. He has that “latter stages of AIDS” thing going on. It’s great for casting. Anyway, but… I didn’t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors’ Union of America said, “You cannot do that.” Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, “All right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, “Can you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?” So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don’t know why. Maybe they’re just lazy. They don’t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I’d ever seen in my life. He was like… Think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of… [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and I’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, “Thank you so much for coming in.” And then we did the dialog together, and I didn’t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, “That’s our guy. That’s who we gotta pick.” And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought… “If he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” So he comes in… He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, “Whoa! What’s going on there, kicky?” And he goes… “Oh, you got me! I’m not disabled.” And I said, “You’re fucking what now?” And he goes, “I’m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.” And I said, “Just shut up. So let me… This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” And he went… “Yeah.” And I said, “You’re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.” And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and I’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and I just think, “I’m gonna call this guy up. I’m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?” And I’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like… And I thought, “This has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” The shutter on his camera has gotta be like… [Mimicking camera shutter] Like… [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “This guy’s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!” Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I’m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “Ta-da!” And we would have gone, “That was very good.” But I’ll tell you what you don’t do. Don’t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, “You did very good.” He’s like, “Thank you, Jim.” [Laughing] [Chuckles] I was, uh… I go to a therapist… ’cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “I’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, “Red,” and I went, “Blue.” And then she went, “Cooking,” and I went, “Food,” and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went… For the last question, she went, “And what’s your favorite thing in the world?” And I went… “Coming on a girl’s face.” Now… Now, I could’ve said things like… “Ice cream” is a good answer. “Hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. But I said, “Coming on a girl’s face.” And I’ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. – I… – [Cheering] I’m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It’s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl’s on her knees and you… It’s so… And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that',\n",
              "  'he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, “When a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” There was never that… never that moment. But, by golly, if it’s not fun. I find it… To… Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, “Bravo!” Don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, “And here’s the women who take a load on their face.” And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “God bless you, ladies.” [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the… Like that… I don’t know why, but I enjoy… I know it’s a lie. I know you’re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it’s such a, “Oh, jeez, I’m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there’s a good chance I’ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.” But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I’m like, “You fucking slut… Oh, I love you. Ah… Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um… Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh… All right, I’m going to get a towel. I’ll get a towel. I’ll get you a towel. All right. You’re a wonderful mother to our child.” [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See… this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I’m there wiping come off his mother’s face. I think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I’m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “Argh!” Like that. And I went… [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, “Hello, Hankie.” And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, “I love my daddy. Love, Hank.” But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the “K,” and… then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, “G’day, Hankie!” And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don’t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I’ve been telling everyone. And I can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He’s been training for this his entire life. I think I’ve, uh… I think I’ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, “Oh, I think like an American person now.” And I’m happy to do it. I just… I’ll tell you what happened. I was flying around… I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I’m so used to airports and stuff here in America that… Okay, what happens is, when you go… I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don’t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “Tickets, please.” And I’m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. ‘Cause I get through airports quick, man. I’m like, “Fucking there you go.” And she went, “Put your ID away. I don’t need to see that.” And I went… “I think you do.” And she went, “I don’t… Why would I need to see your ID?” And I said, “I might be a terrorist.” And she went, “Would showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?” “No, I’d probably still blow the plane up.” So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I’m so good at the airports. I’m already taking my shoes off as I’m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I’m American, and they’re losing their fucking shit. They’re like, “Oh, for fuck’s sake! One of these cunts, eh?” And the TSA guy goes, “Hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” And I went… [Shouting] “I don’t know! Maybe they’re bombs?” And he went… “But they’re not, are they?” I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone’s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “Jeez, mate. That’s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?” “It might also be a bomb.” And then the guy said the most Australian thing I’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. He went… “Oh, come on, mate. You wouldn’t have two bombs.” [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. All right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You’re fucking missing out, mate. If you don’t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine’s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for',\n",
              "  'too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone… He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine’s Day, right? Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running’s their second sport. You wouldn’t have thought that. Anyway… I’m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here’s the difference. Picture my accent, but I’m punching a black person. What I’m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So… she’s coming out of the shower. She’s been drying her hair. She’s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He’s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] “What the fuck is this? I’ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.” And she’s like, “Oh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?” “Who am I? I’m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That’s who the fuck I am.” “Well, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” – [Audience exclaiming] – I know. [Audience laughing] “Oh! Fuck you!” “No! Fuck you! I’m leaving you!” And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “You fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day… that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don’t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!” That’s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. “Oh, you’re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.” She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn’t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar’s one of the few men on Earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so… Boing! Ah! So… I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now… in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look… I’ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. I’ve never raped a man, but… if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. Like, “You want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?” There’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He’s the hero. All right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, – I thank you very much for coming. – [Audience groaning] No, I said, “soon,” not “over.” It’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always… I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I’m going to go, “Fucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.” [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don’t think I’ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don’t know if I’ll be invited this time. They’ll be like, [In South African accent] “We don’t like him. He’s no good.” Anyway, so, I’m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You’ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um… But it was all right ’cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn’t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice ’cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I’ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. So… I’m wearing a white T-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, “Hello,” and the lady goes, [In South African accent] “Oh, Mr. Jefferies, I’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” I said, “You what now?” She goes, “Business class is full. You have been downgraded.” And I said, “I understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.” And she went, “I’m sorry, sir. There’s nothing I can do.” And then I just went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” Now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” And she went, “Please do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!” And I said, “Are you, a white South African, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” Anyway… tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] “What is wrong here? What is wrong?” And I said, “I bought a business class',\n",
              "  'ticket and I want a business class ticket.” And he goes, “What do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can’t do anything.” He goes, “I’ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, “There’s nothing I can do.” So I walk off with my ticket. I’m walking through the airport like, “Fucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, “Tickets, please.” And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] “I’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” And I said… [Inhales sharply] “I bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, “Next.” [Audience exclaiming] “Listen here, you fucking cunt.” [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, “Don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” And I said, “I want to speak to Simon Fulcher,” like I’m… And they go, “All right.” They ring the manager up, and then they go… He goes, “Is it the pale Australian man?” And the guy went, “Yes.” He goes, “We’ve had problems with him. Let him through.” Right? So I go through. I’m sitting there, I’m eating my peanuts. And I’m just angry now, going, “Fucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking…” Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all… And whenever I see Americans abroad… I’ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. You’re just walking around going, [In American accent] “Oh, this is great! Look at that. That’s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what’s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.” Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] “Did anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.” And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, “You can fuck off and all! You don’t know what I’ve been through! I’ve been downgraded!” And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “Fucking downgraded!” And the woman in the group was doing this, “Don’t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?” And all the men in the group were like, “Hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.” ♪ It doesn’t matter These people seem very angry, so ♪ And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] “Hey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.” And then I thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and I said, “Look, mate, don’t worry about it. It’s not like it’s your fault.” And I said, “Why are you in such a big group anyway?” And he goes, “Oh, we’re in Neil Diamond’s band. That’s Neil Diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and I reacted like he was one. I went, “Neil Diamond!” And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] “Hey, what’s going on?” And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, “Neil! Me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” And Neil went, “Oh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.” “You can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!” And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don’t know if you have the Internet, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. “Hey, what have you got there? Hiya!” Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let’s have a drink. Bye.

[rock music playing] [audience cheering] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Joe Rogan. [audience cheering and applauding] What the f*ck is going on, San Francisco? Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, f*ckface! I see you, b*tch! Put your phone down! Motherf*ckers. They can’t use their eyes. Everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I’m high as f*ck. Whoo. It’s strange. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I’m like, “Ugh…” It’s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is… I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people? I had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the f*ck are these people making these things, man? They’re not consistent. That’s also part of the problem. You don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it’s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. It’s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, “Hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” He goes… That’s not a unit of measurement. He’s like, “El diablo. El diablo.” “F*ck, man. How much should I take?” “Just the leg.” “Just the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, “Oh, shit.” They know. They know you’re not gonna die. You’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit. We learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins. [audience laughs] This is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. I’m like, “Um…” For like 20 minutes, I’m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. It’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but… I’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, “How smart are these f*cking things?” Because we’re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… I was thinking, “If people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” They wouldn’t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “I’m taking a chance.” And you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “F*ck! We lost Billy!” The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud. You don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That’s weird. They’re around fishing all the time and like, “B*tch.” They’re f*cking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. I don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. But we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. Right? They don’t send e-mails. They don’t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. You don’t need your fingers. No one’s typing. They have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. All the food’s free. They stay where the water’s warm. I started thinking, “How f*cking smart are they? What if they’re exactly the same as us? What if it’s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?” I was thinking, “What if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” The way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” I was like, “What if that’s',\n",
              "  'exactly how a dolphin feels? They’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin’s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.” And then I started thinking, “What if that’s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We’re just living life through different bodies. What if that’s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if it’s you living another life.” [audience cheering and applauding] I mean… And then I thought, “God damn, how good is this weed I’m getting in California? Whoo! I’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” The problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em. We live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. But it’s the weirdest time ever, too. We’re, like, that close to President Trump. [man 2] No. Boo! “No. Boo!” You boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! All those Bernie Sanders people, “Yo, Bernie’s the shit.” “Did you vote for him?” “Voting ain’t real, bro. It doesn’t even work, dude.” We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby’s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner’s a chick. We’re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense. Nobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. It’s a stupid job. It’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It’s dumb! It’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn’t make any sense. Being president is great if there’s like 50 people. If there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It’s nonsense. It’s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this f*cking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He’s like, “I’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” Trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That’s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We’re down to assholes! Where’s Elon Musk when you need him? Where’s the f*cking geniuses? Where’s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He’s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that. The White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “What are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, “You’re sexist.” No, it’s not sexist. Here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘Cause men can’t even do everything men can do. See? There’s no physical equality, folks. That’s why we have the Olympics. ‘Cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and I can’t do. One of those things is guarding the f*cking White House. I know I can’t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I’ve met Shaquille O’Neal and his dick is where my face is. That’s not equality. That’s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I’m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We’re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don’t think I should, either. It’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is. Well, I’m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They’re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the f*ck out of all of them. Okay? Listen… If they’re guarding the door, I’m getting in. I don’t mean to sound cocky. But I’m just real confident. I could f*ck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we’re different. We’re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I’m not proud of it. I just tell you what’s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I’ll f*ck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are f*cking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, “Whoa! Are we gonna do this? What the f*ck are you doing here?” I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. “Women can do everything men can do. This guy’s a piece of shit. We’re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don’t agree with!” “What the guy said was total bullshit. Total bullshit.” How’d that girl get that job? I’ll tell you how that girl got',\n",
              "  'that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one’s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. If there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. That office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “There’s gotta be a f*cking way. There’s gotta be a f*cking way!” You got this girl who’s like, “I could guard the front door.” “Oh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.” And over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “Debbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?” “No, I don’t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I’m vegan.” And they will just… They will wear patchouli. They will do what the f*ck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor f*cking Debbie at the front door… “Why am I alone?” [chuckles] The whole story is so bananas. And it’s one of my favorite stories. So I’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. ‘Cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. There’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, “The government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government’s watching us all the time.” They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn’t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an “X” where the White House is. They’re like, “You’re good to go.” They let him go! Two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don’t… That’s like a suicide run. That’s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, “What kind of security do you think they have at the White House?” “Oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” Nope. Turns out they don’t even have a dog. You just f*cking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That’s a guy who wants to die! He’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “F*ck the government! F*ck my ex-wife! And f*ck everybody! I’m gonna do this! F*ck you!” Just sprinting, “Oh, my God, I’m doing it! Oh, my God, I’m doing it!” Thinking, with every step, “This is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this…” And he gets to the front door. It’s unlocked! He opens it. There’s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He’s probably going, “Why am I alive?” He’s probably thinking… He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, “I wanted to die. I don’t want to go to f*cking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?” Then he was probably pissed. “Where are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles] Imagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, “Everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?” Obama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? “So, let me see what the people have to say.” He’d just go, “Obama is a…” [groans] “I’m none of those f*cking things.” Freakin’ out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, “Why the f*ck did I do this?” I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can’t quit once you’re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, “Good morning, Mr. President,” he was probably like, “Oh, no! What the f*ck did I do this for? I didn’t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can’t sleep. I’m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the f*ck is guarding me?” Looks out in the hallway. There’s a girl taking selfies. That’d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the White House. [laughs] You know I’m not making this up. You’ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. You just, like… Like there’s something wrong with your back. That’s a recognizable pose. When did that start? ‘Cause if you look at the original pictures',\n",
              "  'back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… She’s a f*cking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. “Oh, people like that. They like what I’m doing.” Combo. A two-hole combo attractor. It’s all over online! It gets you a lot of likes. I saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That’s it. She’s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There’s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she’s just a regular girl, man. I’m watching this, I’m like, “This is a different kind of person.” She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn’t have a job that they like. She doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. They’re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don’t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. There’s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. And she’s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… That’s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I’m not like those other assholes. I’m different. I care. I care about who she is. I’m a nice person. I’m a hero or something. [laughs] “I’m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.” Mmm. If we get to come. If men don’t get to come, we get real Sméagol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] “Mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.” Everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There’s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There’s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They’re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. Right? If it’s someone you love, your real friend… If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I’ll be like, “B*tch, where the f*ck are you going? You’re gonna go to Florida? We can’t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the f*ck are you moving to Florida, man?” But you might be able to deal with it. “We can just visit each other every now and then.” But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you’d be like, “Oh, really? Get in the f*cking car! Just get in the car, dude.” Take him out to Death Valley, “Look around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.” Jesus Christ! There’s places in America you can’t live, man. You don’t wanna live in Detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “Hey, dude. Seriously? You think there’s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars ’cause California’s almost out of water.” Then he’ll nod, like, “Yeah, b*tch.” We’re right next to the ocean. What the f*ck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world’s blue. It’s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don’t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning… “Too complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.” Oh, my God! You’re f*cking crazy. We’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We’re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, “Man, I gotta build a new house.” No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! We’re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you’re gonna have. It’s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, “They’re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they’re',\n",
              "  'smart enough to figure out how to get back.” Here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren’t going. See, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… They talk German and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That’s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter.” Then they make another one. They shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who’s in? You’re gonna all come with me. We’re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it. I watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I’m Clear. I’m back! I’m back now. If you haven’t seen… [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, ’cause I have a neighbor who’s a Scientologist, and I don’t even think he’s gay. I don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. His house is… I mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. It’s like, “What does this crazy f*ck believe?” And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, “I don’t see any red flags. I think we’re good. I think this is legit as f*ck.” If Scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. It’s like it’s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, “B*tch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don’t have video of Joseph Smith. There’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the f*ck is going on with you people?” I watched it with my mom, and it was like… First of all, Scientology, they don’t pay taxes. That’s disturbing. They’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, “Everything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.” Well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out… I don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It’s created by one person. That person knows it’s bullshit. In a religion, that dude’s dead. So it’s a religion ’cause L. Ron Hubbard’s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “I can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “You made me go to Catholic school. The f*ck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.” Imagine if I talked to my mom like that. Oh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don’t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It’s too confusing. And I think we’re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. There’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here’s why. They don’t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here’s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It’s fantastic. If you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. But it’s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, “If you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.” They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn’t get mad. They didn’t get defensive. They didn’t kill anybody. That’s a good cult. They just said, “What do you wanna do?” “We got nine wives. Shut the f*ck up!” “Everybody just… Everybody, just chill. Just chill.” That’s a good religion. That’s a',\n",
              "  'good cult. Some cults aren’t that good. They get f*cking testy. You know the one. We don’t have to say who. You know what I’m talking about. There’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “Come on, man. I can’t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?” “No loopholes!” “F*ckin’ relax, bro.” And this isn’t just theoretical. People have died ’cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. F*cking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you… When there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird. Because when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn’t see ’em in the LA Times. You couldn’t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “Oh. I don’t wanna get killed. I don’t wanna show the pictures.” It was weird, until… the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas… where they promptly held a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. I’m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I’ll wait. They had a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin’ in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? You ever go to Texas? That’s not Santa Monica, b*tch. That’s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They’re not supposed to be there. People didn’t evolve in Texas. It’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. “Y’all go ahead. We’re gonna hang back here. I’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. My wife’s got the biggest titties. I’mma try to f*ck a snake. I think it can be done.” They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike. And that’s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It’s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. ‘Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It’s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It’s f*cking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” And everybody’s worried about… It’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. “Oh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this f*cking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.” [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, “We stick together. We’re all in this together.” That’s how they are in Texas, too. They’re like, “Y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” They have a f*cking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They’re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It’s not even a state. It’s a republic. They were like, “Man, we ain’t so sure about this whole United States thing. We’re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.” They don’t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here’s how I know this. I’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I’m gonna repeat it because I know you’re like, “Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” No. There’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in Texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “It don’t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!” One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “Shit, I didn’t know we could get tigers.” And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, “I ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We’re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We’re gonna need some real warrior genes. We’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, “Chris Kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come. We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the children.',\n",
              "  'Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you f*ckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs] I have kids and I lie to them. I get high around ’em, too. People say you shouldn’t do that, but they don’t see it. They say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I’m not. I’m high. I call it “elevated.” It’s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “Who are you?” What do you think? What’s the worst thing that can happen if I’m a little high around my kid? They’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “Look out. Don’t go there.” That’s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I’m high, I’m like, “You know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “Yeah, I know it’s not a baby.” “Do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “Maybe.” “Okay. That’s cool. That’s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.” [kisses] It’s weird, man. It’s weird raising little people. There’s some things that I didn’t expect. One of the things I didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. You have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. You don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. But you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. So you got… You got a little bit of… You’re like, “Oh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?” And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they’re like, “Dad, what the f*ck?” You’re like, “Aw… Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.” Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I’m like, “When do we tell ’em?” This lady goes, “When they’re 11.” They’re gonna be f*cking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn’t believe me. I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m off by a year.” That’s not as funny, but it’s… I didn’t mean it. But it’s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They’re like, “I teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.” “Eh… when you see ’em.” But unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. They’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. That’s all she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about getting stuffed. She’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she’s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, “Yeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It’s that big. What the f*ck? Teacher’s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?” They play dumb. They play dumb! They’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. They’re little humans. They wanna run shit. “Who is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the f*ck is going on?” I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “How the f*ck?” “Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?” “No, honey, I’ve never met him.” “But you let him in the house?” And there’s this moment… It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You’re like, “Oh, shit.” I don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, “Yeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That’s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. You can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, “How do birds fly?” I go, “Birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? But it’s actually a bunch of gases. That’s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.” “Whoa!” “Yeah, nature is crazy.” “Yeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?” “Magic! Christmas magic! Now go to bed. I’m trying to f*ck your mom!',\n",
              "  'Go to bed!” [audience laughing] Jokes, folks. Just jokes. Can’t talk like that. That’s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They’re little, tiny people. They’re adorable. They don’t know anything yet. You gotta teach ’em everything. You can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, they’re like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I f*cking do. I f*cking do.” The guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. And that’s what it’s like in school. My daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named Debbie. And every day it’s, “Debbie says…” Oh, f*cking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don’t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. And some of ’em are crazy. My daughter’s like, “Debbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?” [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don’t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don’t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “I don’t know.” I’m like, “Sweetie, I don’t know. I don’t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it’s not something you can measure. So it’s not something you can see. So we don’t know. But here’s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “Yeah.” “Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It’s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. Their kid is f*cked! And everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. There’s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I’m gonna shut this light out, and I’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. All right?” I don’t say these things. I don’t say any of these things! I was like, “I don’t know. Maybe Debbie’s right. Doesn’t make sense to me. How would that work?” “How would that work?” “It wouldn’t work, would it?” Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start f*cking each other. Is that what happens? Mom f*cks the kids, or the… Yeah, exactly. Debbie’s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth’s 10,000 years old. They’re Young Earth Christians. They’re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them… I’m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they’re sweet. They’re really nice people. I hug ’em every time I see ’em. They’re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “I have no use for this.” [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “This f*cking thing’s confusing.” They’re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I’m like, “How many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?” Uh! I looked it up. There’s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “How old’s the Earth?” Number one answer is, “Older than your mother’s pussy.” And then they hang up. Number two answer is, “F*ck you!” After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That’s Debbie’s f*cking parents. So out of the people that answer polls… Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that f*cking stupid. And that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. We’re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who… They’re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don’t. They’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful. But there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. That’s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the f*ck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, “You ain’t shit without your dad, pussy.” These are monsters. This is not a normal person’s response. Normal people don’t leave comments. What a normal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don’t like it. That’s it. It ends right there. But what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown',\n",

[mimics fart] Ugh… Dear, Jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see…” Just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, “Let me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. Oh!” And you know who’s dumber than them? Me. ‘Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they’re stupid. I still get upset. F*ck! This is the world, folks. This is the world we’re living in. Are we happy? I’m not sure. Is this what we wanted? I don’t know. [woman] No! No. [woman] No! Are you sure? [woman] No! Why are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom? What’s happening? [woman 2] No! Are you White Panthers? What is this? [man] Life sucks! What are you saying? [man] Life can kind of suck sometimes. Life can kind of suck? Maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “Life can kind of suck.” It’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “Yeah, I’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” It doesn’t get any better than today, man. So stupid. “Make America great again.” It’s as good as it’s ever been. What the f*ck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It’s never been better. This is as good as it’s ever been. It’s just weird. It’s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, b*tch. Don’t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “I think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” You’re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I’m not unhappy. I’ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. But when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don’t think about it while it’s happening. It’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. And when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “Hmm…” They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They’ll just start poking at you. It’s what people do. It’s natural. It’s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you’re on Verizon, they’re like, “Dude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a f*cking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it’s at. Wake up! Join us!” When you’re with all girls, they just start… They constantly f*ck with my manhood. It’s like, I’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I’m like, “Why is this pink?” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” And my wife’s like, “I think they’re right.” I’m like, “Oh… I see what the f*ck is going on here. It’s mutiny!” They just chip, chip, chip away. It’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack… You can’t say shit. You can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “I still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I’ll deal with this eventually.” But you’re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin’. You don’t do anything about it. You’re like, “I gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.” And men don’t want to admit that. “Not me, bro. Not me, bro. I’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” What are you, a f*cking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit? No one’s honest. No one’s honest about how much we need other people. That’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, “Wow, what a rebel!” But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We’re f*cking weird. We are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we’re all in denial. “I’m kind of a loner.” Oh, shut the f*ck up. There’s no such thing. It’s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You’re like, “I’ll do more of that.” You find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “I’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don’t like that feeling. Hmm.” That’s what we do. That’s what we do. It’s weird. We don’t want to admit it. But',\n",
              "  'that’s who we all are. And I’m just telling you this because I’ve never been more of a b*tch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I’m in this position. This is how I’m riding out my days, just like this. “Okay, okay, okay, okay.” But I’m also telling you right now that I’m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That’s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here’s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own… Not really. This is what everybody’s take is. This is the take that you’re supposed to have. “He’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a f*ck? You should do whatever you wanna do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don’t care what you do. But… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. That’s all I’m saying. I don’t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who’s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘Cause right now, we lost a f*cking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect! We’re down Bruce Jenner. And I’ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don’t exactly like what I’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don’t see what I’m seeing? We are watching the plot of a f*cking Stephen King book play out! An American athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he’s beautiful. You tell me you don’t see what I’m seeing? You have to say… You have to say she’s beautiful. “She’s beautiful.” She’s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I’d be even more disgusting. “Beauty’s unusual.” There’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus f*cking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That’s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.” Ahhh! Bang! I can’t! The world’s gone f*cking bananas! “What you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. You’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “Bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] I can’t. I can’t be one of you. I was… I was born a man.” “Nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You’re free. Bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of Vanity Fair.” “Huh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you f*cking with me? Because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “It can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams… can be real through surgery. Sleep.” [audience cheering and applauding] Thank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great f*cking time with you savages! Let’s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys. Thank you very much!

Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.” You’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.” It’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?\\'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around. I talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation.',\n",
              "  'Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?” My wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.” I grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, we all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And',\n",
              "  \"with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.” My wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.” I have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.” I loved\",\n",
              "  'our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!” I didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo. It’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I',\n",
              "  'was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was. And there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the',\n",
              "  \"Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.” Kids have it very good now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.” No, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.” My dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero. The weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if\",\n",
              "  'you’re white. It’s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.” What are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy. I was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.” I temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I',\n",
              "  \"have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy. That’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it. I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they\",\n",
              "  'knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS. That is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president. And I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton. My mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton. Now, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later? So, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!” I learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about',\n",
              "  'all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!” Anyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service. We land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life. And I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992. Let’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.

I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all. “The Old Lady And The Dog” I live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom! “My Daughter Likes Fish” You ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts\",\n",
              "  'about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!” “The Food Chain” Must be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah. “Courtyard Confrontation” I live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek',\n",
              "  'god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was. “Getting What ‘Old’ Is” I’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and',\n",
              "  'open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.” “Putting On Socks” The worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks. “If You’re Older You’re Smarter” I don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some',\n",
              "  'experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go. “Getting Older Makes My Life Better” I like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared. “Everybody Has Their Time” Everybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.” “Dating Takes Courage” It’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides,',\n",
              "  'Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.” “First Date” I always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there. “Tits” Guys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a',\n",
              "  'young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!” “Divorce” I’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad',\n",
              "  'it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad. “Videoing Your Kids” My daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!” “Life Is A Good Deal” Don’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it ending. “Behind The Wheel” It’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like,',\n",
              "  'most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man. “If Murder Was Legal” A lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought. “Of Course, But Maybe” You know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the',\n",
              "  'good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit. Thanks a lot, folks. You guys were great. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.

The material lacks the sharpness and rhythm that usually define her performances, leaving many of the jokes feeling more like filler than punchlines. Her critique of Dave Chappelle, while likely well-intentioned, detracts from the overall experience, coming off as more self-serving than impactful. The show struggles to find its footing, and what could have been a milestone performance instead leaves an impression of missed potential and underwhelming delivery. Michelle Buteau’s comedy special, A Buteau-ful Mind at Radio City Music Hall, premiered on December 31, 2024, and is available for streaming on Netflix. * * * [woman] Don’t forget, brush your teeth. [boy] Why do I have to brush my teeth? [woman] Want your teeth to fall out? [boy] Only one of them. You’re gonna need your teeth. I’ll tell you why. I have to go. Mama’s gonna make herstory. [boy] What’s herstory? I’ll tell you what herstory is later. And the rest of the world. [upbeat instrumental music plays] [audience cheering and applauding] [song continues playing] [cheering swells] [audience continues cheering] [female MC] Are you ready to make history? [audience cheers and applauds] [female MC] Please welcome the first woman to have her own stand-up comedy special at Radio City Music Hall! Michelle Buteau! [audience cheering] [song continues playing] Thank you. [crowd cheering] [audience shouts and whistles] [music fades] New York City! [audience cheering] [Michelle] You do it every time. [woman 1] Woo! I love you so much. [cheering swells] “Okay, is she good? Is she good?” [woman 2] Yes! Oh man. [woman 3] We love you, Michelle! I love you too, bitch. [audience cheers] I’d motorboat you right now, but I got shit to do. [crowd laughs] [Michelle sighs] I love doing what I love and making money. [crowd cheering] [crowd applauding] What? [chuckles] It’s amazing. And I wish that for you. If you haven’t done that yet, I really wish that for you. [audience cheers] ‘Cause it’s good. It’s good. [audience laughs] This guy hit me up one time. He said, “I’m a food cooking producer.” I said, “Go off, is that a real job?” [audience laughs] “Good for you. Make your space.” [chuckles] He said, “I’d love to do a cooking video with you because you like cooking.” I said, “I never said that. That’s just my look.” [snickers] [audience laughs] “Okay.” He’s like, “I have the perfect recipe. Sweet potato casserole.” And I was like, “Okay.” “How much does it pay?” And what he told me, I was surprised, because that comma was thick. [audience laughing] I said, “This is a nice check.” “Do I have to show my feet or some shit?” [crowd laughs] I’ve seen Euphoria, I know what the kids are doing for money. [audience laughing] And he said, “No, the company I work for loves you.” I can’t legally tell you the name of the company, but I can tell you that it rhymes with “Tampbell’s Loop.” [audience laughs] [scattered applause] We all got it? There’s always one. [crowd laughs] [Michelle chuckles] I didn’t read the recipe. I showed up on time with a V-neck and some lip gloss. I was like, “Let’s make some casserole, honey.” [audience laughs] They handed me sweet potatoes. I was like, “Sweet potatoes,” to the camera, “That’s my nickname.” [vocalizes] [crowd laughs] [Michelle chuckles] The director’s like, “This is a family recipe.” I said, “I know.” [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] Hamming it up. Then they handed me salt and pepper. I was like, “Salt-N-Pepa’s here. Salt, salt, salt.” [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] Then these people, and I’m going to call them people, because I know that they’re someone’s child, um… [smacks lips] They handed me two full cups of shredded cheddar cheese. And I had the same look on my face. I was like, “Are we making the same recipe?” [audience laughing] They said, “Yeah, it ties it together.” I said, “Who told you that?” [audience laughing] They said, “Gotta put it in.” I said, “Listen, now, once I put it in, I can’t take it out.” [crowd laughs] “It’s like pee in the pool, okay?” [audience laughing] Then these people… [chuckling] [audience laughing] …handed me a',\n",
              "  'can of Tampbell’s Loop… [audience cheers and applauds] …Cream of Mushroom Soup. [audience laughs] [Michelle sighs] [audience laughing] Now, I don’t know if y’all have ever seen a fresh can… of Tampbell’s Loop… [audience laughing] …Cream of Mushroom Soup, but… she’s dense, okay? I was like, “Ow, we gotta put our back into it.” “You gotta… get a little room temperature.” [crowd laughs] I mean, I’m mixing it up, and it’s a mess. It looks like a dog just had a miscarriage. [audience groaning and laughing] Oh, that dog got more rights for its body than I do, what you talking about? [audience cheering] That bitch will be okay. [audience laughs] So, I’m trying to mix it up, and the director’s like, “What’s wrong, Michelle?” [chuckles] “Smile.” [snickers] [audience laughs] [Michelle hums] [humming continues] [hums, quavers] [audience laughs] [humming fades] So, I put this thing… in the oven, and I tell everybody, “Okay. Get home safe.” [audience laughing] [chuckles] The director goes, “We gotta take it out and eat it and talk about it.” I said… “Who told you that?” [audience laughs] He said, “All the videos, everyone’s eating it and talking about it.” I said, “We don’t have to be them. We could be heroes.” [audience laughs] [chuckling] He… He said, “I’m so sorry, Michelle.” “But unless you eat it and talk about it, we can’t pay you. It’s in your contract.” So I pulled it out the oven, I was like… [hums] [audience laughs] When I took it out of the oven, y’all, it was bubbling. It looked so personal. [audience laughing] I put it on the countertop, it was just giving the “Caucacity of Nope.” [audience laughing] [sighing] So I put this thing… in my mouth. And I’m really trying to think about what I can spend the money on. [audience laughing] Like a good ho. [audience laughing] [scattered applause] Thank you. Hear those people clapping? Them the hoes. [audience laughs and applauds] With the bills. [chuckling] And he was like, you know, “How do you feel?” And I’m like, “Like I’m in an episode of Fear Factor.” [crowd laughs] And he’s like, “Okay, how does it taste?” I’m like, “Expensive.” [audience laughing] And then I wasn’t crying, but it was a gentle tear, and he’s like, “You can go home now.” [chuckles] [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] So he posts the video, and I’m like, “Who gonna see it?” Who gonna see this 40-second video of me making sweet potato casserole, right? Well… [audience laughs] I forgot there’s this thing called Black Twitter. [audience laughing] And you know? That’s my bad. The minute I saw myself trending, I was like, “My bad.” I forgot sweet potatoes are the Juneteenth of root vegetables. That… is my bad. I need a publicist, an apology tour, I tried to get on Club Shay Shay. He was booked up. [audience laughing] Amanda Seales was about to do a three-part video on my ass. I had to watch High on the Hog seven more times. Ooh, baby! Can’t be light-skinned, fucking up Black culture. I won’t be invited to any of the fests. [scattered applause] But I’ve never seen over 10,000 tweets with my name, so I was like, “How bad could it be?” [audience laughs] Well, there was an auntie who posted every hour on the hour, all in caps. I said, “Okay, consistency.” [chuckling] All in caps, she kept writing, “CALL THE COPS!” What? [crowd laughs] What? [scoffs] [chuckles] We ain’t gotta involve the police. [crowd laughs] Then a lot of people were like, “Is Michelle okay?” I said, “Thank you so much.” [audience laughing] I don’t know, I really got to look in, you know? Check in on your strong friends. [chuckling] But the most, like, hilarious, yet hurtful comment that I do remember, somebody was just like, “Damn…” “Sis looks like the housekeeper from Get Out.” [audience laughing] [imitating the housekeeper] No! No! [wailing] No! [wailing louder] No! [screaming] No! [audience laughing] No! [audience laughing] [Michelle sighs] I just realized how crazy that shit is for you if you’ve never seen Get Out. [audience laughs] Like, are you okay? [audience laughs] I’m just bad at internet. I don’t know how to not care. I either shut off or I just care too much. I thought the hardest conversations I would have with my children would be around racism, being bullied, sexism, but I’m realizing, I have to figure out how to have a proper conversation with my kids, to have them define their worth without likes and followers. [audience applauds] Yes, welcome to my big-titty TED Talk, bitches. [audience laughs] With dreams as big as her shoulder pads. [crowd laughing] And, you know, my kids are so smart. I’m hoping it won’t be hard. I have five-year-old',\n",
              "  'twins. [crowd cheers] Thank you. I have boy-girl twins until they tell me otherwise, ’cause Mama is inclusive. [crowd cheers] Let’s love and evolve, mother… They have the cutest names, I think. They have family names, Hazel and Otis. So cute. I got earrings with their initials. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] That’s right. She’s a ho for life. [audience laughs] [audience applauds] Oh my goodness. Rosé, it’s so wet. [audience laughs] I didn’t realize, with twins, everybody wants to talk to you. I didn’t know that. People, like, walk up to me with agency and purpose. They’re like, “Are they twins?” I’m like, “Are you a pediatrician?” [audience laughs] But usually it’s someone that’s always a twin, and wanna tell me they’re a twin. Like, “Are they twins? I’m a twin.” “I don’t like my twin. We share a birthday cake.” I’m like, “There’s a war going on.” [audience laughing] “What?” “What?” And they just stay. “Yeah, my mom likes my twin better.” I’m like, “I see why.” [audience laughing] They keep talking. I’m like, “I gotta stop you there.” “I’m not friendly. I just have a double chin.” [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckling] “I’m an asshole, it’s just rosé and butter. That’s all it is.” [crowd howling] Makes you very approachable. Gout is very approachable. [crowd titters] And I didn’t realize how different kids could be when they’re the same ingredient. They are so different. Like Hazel? Wow. Hazel has the energy of a 53-year-old Black woman that works at the DMV. [audience laughing] She is wild, she walks up in the playground, she’s like, “Is this what y’all meant to do?” [audience laughing] Hazelnut. The kids come up to me like, “Mrs. Buteau, Hazel’s looking through my soul again.” [audience laughing] We got to do better. Oh my God. She’s sassy. I don’t know where she gets it from. [crowd laughs] Okay, you know what? I understand what you’re talkin’ about. However, I didn’t find my voice till I was in my 30s. She’s five. [crowd laughing] I was leaving the house one time in short sleeves to go food shopping, ’cause that’s all I motherfucking do. [crowd laughing] And she said, “Mama, you should put on long sleeves ’cause your elbows look old.” [audience laughing] But here’s the thing, she ain’t wrong. My elbows look haunted as fuck. How? When? No one tells you about that in your 40s. It looks like I’ve been doing a plank for 22 years. [audience howling] How would I know my elbows look like the top of a pigeon’s head? When? Ladies, what all I need? Ashwagandha? What do I need? Magnesium? These elbows look crazy. My elbows look like the guy in the Indiana Jones movie, that chose the wrong cup. [audience laughing] Thank you, everybody over 38. Thank you. Thank you. I see you. [crowd applauds] [Michelle laughs] Oh my God, sassy children. And they don’t go to bed. They just are up all the time. She comes downstairs, 10:00 p.m. “Mama, what you doing?” I’m like, “Hiding my vape pen now. What’s good?” [audience laughing] “What’s up?” “You already had two bananas. What all you need now?” [chuckles] [scoffing] My God. And sassy children, they go to bed late, they wake up early. She’s up 5:30 a.m. every day. I said, “Go back to bed, girl.” “You ain’t missing anything.” [crowd chuckles] “There is nothing going on right now.” “We don’t live on a farm.” [audience laughs] “This is not the military.” “You can go back to bed.” Oh my God. Hazel has so much energy. She is like… Picture DJ Khaled as a five-year-old girl. [audience laughs] She wakes up in the morning, she’s like, “Good morning, everybody!” [air horn plays] [audience applauding] [audience continues applauding] [Michelle chuckles] ♪ All I do is twin, twin, twin! ♪ [air horn playing] She the best! Yeah! DJ Donwill, everybody. [audience cheers and applauds] [Michelle laughs] Oh my God. I can’t talk to Otis the way I talk to Hazel, ’cause he’s so sweet and, like, quiet. Like, Hazel brings the Black mom out of me, but like a Black mom on Maury Povich. [audience laughing] Oh, baby. We be at Target, I’m like, [seething] “Get over here, girl.” “We ain’t buying no more stuff. We ain’t buy… Put it down!” [crowd laughs] She makes me feel like an angry ventriloquist. “Get over here!” “Put it down. I said no more stuff, we ain’t buying no more stuff.” [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckling] I can’t talk to Otis like that. Otis has the energy of a tired husband holding his wife’s purse at Macy’s. [crowd laughing] I see some of y’all in here tonight. Thank you so much. [audience chuckling] Otis is so sweet. He even blinks slow when he talks.',\n",
              "  'He’s like, “Mama…” [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] [Michelle chuckles] I feel bad sometimes, because he’s growing up in a house with so much, like, strong female energy, but I’m also just like, “You’re welcome.” [audience cheers] You know? “That’s the best kind of education you won’t get in school.” [chuckling] I feel bad for him sometimes, his first complete sentence when he was three years old was, “Okay, everybody. Calm down.” [audience laughs] Otis! I’m trying to teach him how to be a big boy around the city, you know? Walking a New York City sidewalk, ride the subway, the train. Hold the door open for old people, all that shit. It’s important. And we were on a very crowded corner one time in New York City, and he yells in front of everybody, “Mama, the blinking hand said we can’t go now!” I said, “That’s right, baby.” And then strangers were just like, “Good job, Mama.” “Good job…” And parents know when your kid does something right in public, you’re like, “I am a fucking angel.” [audience laughing] “I am a walking angel. What are you childless fucks doing? Recycling? Okay.” “Okay.” “Composting? Okay.” We are leaving it better than how we found it. Otis caught wind, and he was very proud of himself. And so then he yells, “Mama, the white man said we can go now!” [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] Oh my God. So I call this story “Birth Control.” ‘Cause if you were thinking about having a kid, listen to this and decide. [crowd laughs] Otis had a big booger in his nose. A big booger and he’s like, “Mama, how do I get this out?” Like, “That’s a real question?” Know when your kid says something you’re like, “I’m worried for the rest of your life”? [crowd laughing] I said, “Put your finger in there, dig like you’re looking for an answer.” [audience chuckles] What am I, Mr. Rogers? I don’t know. He had a hard time getting it. I was like, “Otis, this is hard to watch.” [audience laughing] “I’m gonna be honest with ya.” His head was leaning back. Chasing himself like a dog chasing his tail. I was like, “This is not how I want to remember you, you know?” [crowd laughs] He’s like, “Mama, I can’t get it.” I’m like, “I see that.” I should also mention we were boarding a flight. [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] And he said, “Mama, I can’t get it.” And so, I made a decision. I went in there and I got it. [crowd laughs] And then he did a move I’ve never seen a human body do. He folded like a beach chair. [crowd laughs] Laid out on the floor. He was like… [squeaking sounds] And then laid. What? And lay down. And then he yelled… [chuckling] “Mama, I want to get my booger!” And then he says, “Put it back.” [audience laughs] And there were people behind me. And I had a decision to make. So I put it back. [audience laughing and groaning] [scattered applause] See, half y’all clap and half y’all judge, and I see that shit. Okay? That’s how people looked at me. I wanted to yell at them, like, “I used to be cool, okay?” “I was cool. I’ve done cocaine off of a dick, I know how complicated noses can be, bitch.” “Enjoy your overhead space.” [scattered cheering and clapping] [Michelle chuckling] It’s a good time to give my mom a shout-out in the audience. [audience cheers and applauds] Hi, Mom. Hi, Marie. [chuckles] Oh man, I must have been a sassy kid, ’cause I feel her bone density be different. [crowd laughs] Like, I get it now, you know? I don’t like to complain, but I feel run-down, y’all. You know, like, don’t let the sequence and tulle fool you. [crowd laughs] I am run-down, like, if you come to my house, 5:30 every night, you can catch me on the couch, and I am serving Viola Davis tired. [audience laughs] [puffing and panting] [labored breathing] [imitating Viola Davis] “I’m so tired.” [fake crying] [gasps] [normal voice] So tired. Now I know why my mom looks like that. [audience chuckling] My mom looks like a husky dog in Miami, like… I don’t know if she’s thirsty or smiling, it’s just… [audience laughing] [panting heavily] [huffs] She always looks like she’s asking the question and answering it, like… [audience laughing] [Michelle panting heavily] Now I get it. Now I get it. I feel like the door at the end of the movie Titanic. [audience laughing] Just, like, less buoyant, and everyone’s climbing on. My whole family is trying to take a seat. [crowd chuckling] And my whistle won’t work, I’m like… [blows a raspberry] [keeps blowing',\n",
              "  'a raspberry] [blows a raspberry harder] [blows a faint raspberry] [audience tittering] I get it! I get it. I didn’t even realize, like, you could hurt yourself when you’re taking care of kids, ’cause you’re not thinking about how you move your body. And I hurt myself ’cause I’m bending over all the time, and not in the way I like. Air horn! [air horn sound plays] [audience applauding] [chuckling] Thank you. I hurt myself real bad one time. And my husband was like, “I think you got sciatica.” And I didn’t even know what it was. That’s how young I was. [audience laughs] I thought it was an overpriced pasta. [audience laughs] He said, “I think it’s sciatica.” I said, “Check the receipt. It’s Penne Pomodoro.” [audience laughs] That’s how young I was. Make some noise if you know what sciatica is. [audience cheers] Yes! I love a grown crowd. Thanks for keeping your muscles in check. “I can’t come to the show tonight.” “My sciatica is picking up right now.” Oh my God, I have readers now, what? I can’t see a menu. I’m that bitch. “Turn your light on.” [crowd laughs] “Why are these restaurants so dark?” [audience laughs] I’m this old. [audience laughs] Oh my God, I hurt myself with the sciatica and I went to the doctor. He gave me athlete’s-grade ibuprofen. I was like, “Yes, I am an athlete, good job.” [crowd chuckling] And he gave me a Theragun. Y’all know what a Theragun is? [cheers] Awesome. I didn’t know. I was like, “Okay, massage gun helping me out through the day.” “Come on.” And I couldn’t go nowhere, so I had a friend over and she happens to be a beautiful Black lesbian. I call her “The Oracle.” [crowd laughing] She ever-knowing and glowing. And she saw my Theragun on my table and she goes, “Okay.” [audience laughs] I said, “Girl, that’s for my sciatica.” And she’s like, “Whatever.” [crowd howling] I said, “Girl, it’s my Theragun.” “It’s got the word ‘gun’ in it.” And she said, “Depends where you point it.” [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] I said, “Girl.” She said, “Girl, what?” I said, “Girl, you stop.” She said, “What?” I looked at her, I said, “Girl.” [audience laughs] “You like to get your pussy beat up like that?” [audience laughing] [woman] Woo! [applause fades] I said, “Girl.” “You like to get your pussy beat up like that?” [crowd laughing] “I had no idea you like to get your pussy beat up like that, you are so quiet.” [audience laughs] I said, “Oh my God. You finish your book in two weeks.” “You always over-tip at Starbucks.” “You always park so far away from the entrance to get your steps in.” “I had no idea you like to get your pussy beat up like that.” [crowd laughs] She said, “Yeah, girl.” [chuckling] “I’m spending so much on Theraguns trying to find the right one.” I said, “Girl!” [crowd laughs] [yelling] “My brain is melting.” I said, “Honestly? Real talk?” “You should have somebody punch your pussy a bit.” [audience laughing] “Nothing crazy, just have somebody punch your pussy a little bit.” [crowd continues laughing] “Nothing crazy, just a little pow-pow in your puss.” [audience laughing] A little, “Knock, knock.” “Who’s there?” “It’s my pussy, me-ouch.” [audience laughs and applauds] “That’s all.” She looked at me. She said, “Hell no, girl. A Theragun is Therafun.” I said, “What in the lesbian Shark Tank is going on?” [audience laughing] “You got slogans?” I had no idea she like to get her pussy beat up like that. You think you know somebody. Can I just recap what had happened right now? I told y’all a true-ass story about my beautiful Black lesbian friend. And a little bit of violence on a puss. Nothing crazy, a dollop will do you. [crowd laughs] And for the most part, we laughed. Some of y’all were judging. Some of y’all were curious. [audience laughs] You don’t see what I see. [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckles] But all I’m saying is it can be done. It can be done, we can tell jokes and stories and not disparage a whole community. We can do that. We can make it funny. We just have to work at it, right? [applause] So if you ever run into Dave Chappelle, can you let him know that shit? [audience cheers loudly] I don’t think he know that shit. I don’t think we’ll run into Dave, ’cause he’s the GOAT. And he is the GOAT, if that means going off about trans people. Dave. It’s not funny. It’s dangerous. Make it funny. [audience cheering and applauding] [Michelle] That’s all. I can’t believe somebody would make millions of dollars for making people feel unsafe. That is',\n",
              "  'so wild to me, like… Truly. [crowd cheers] [crowd cheers and claps] I’m manifesting this shit tonight, this is a Radio City Music Hall takeover, and I’m gonna tell everybody, I wanna make millions and millions of dollars for making people feel safe, seen, secure, heard, and entertained. Entertained. Entertaining. [crowd cheers] What are we doing? That is my goal. My goal used to be to find my belly button when I sit down, but that shit ain’t realistic. [crowd laughs] Girl, set yourself up for success. [audience laughs] Just have some goals. I just don’t know why people aren’t doing it anymore. You know? Say you do the thing, and then do the thing. [audience cheers and applauds] That’s all. Like my friends that are, like, stuck. Right? Always dating the wrong person. The way you do one thing is the way you do everything. Right? If you were in the theater tonight, dating somebody that’s not good for you, especially the ladies, don’t do it no more. Leave here tonight and unfollow that motherfucker. That’s energy you don’t have. [audience applauds] Okay? And I’m not a chiropractor, but you ain’t gonna be wet forever, sis. [audience laughs] God. It is a journey, though. You got to really, like, find the right one, you know? I’ve fucked a lot of frogs. [audience laughs] It was like a frog farm. [crowd laughing] I’m so glad I found the right one. It’s so nice. [crowd applauds] It really is. When people meet me and my husband, they’re like, “Wow, you guys like each other.” I’m like, “You’re supposed to.” Why be with somebody you don’t like? That is what your family is for. [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckles] Hello? But I also think it’s important to, like, name the good time and name the bad times, that’s okay. The hardest time my husband and I had definitely was the pandemic. I didn’t get how social we were until we were together all… the fucking time. [crowd laughs] I would move to another room, he’d follow me. I’ll be like, “What’s up?” [audience laughs] “What’s up?” His stories were terrible. [audience laughs] Like, “What’s good?” He’s like, “We ain’t got clean spoons.” I’m like, “Great story.” [crowd laughs] [Michelle sighs] [chuckles] It was a bad time. I started using this tone with him that I’d never used with anybody before. It’s like the tone you use when Alexa ain’t playing your song. [audience laughs] You know that tone? I was like, [yelling] “No. I. Said…” [normal voice] What? Why am I talking to him like that? I love him. [woman howling] Name the good, name the bad. That’s how you get over it, celebrate it. Honestly, like, what I love about me and my husband is that we’re real partners, right? Like, we celebrate each other’s wins. And if you’re with someone who’s jealous of you, they don’t understand your power because they’re not in their power. [audience cheers and applauds] Oh my goodness. Look at me, shoulder pads. Dropping some wisdom. Where’s the donation basket? Come on, now. [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] Truly, we celebrate shit. I celebrate the small things. You got to, otherwise you have nothing to celebrate. I’ll pop a bottle of champagne on Wednesday ’cause I paid a parking ticket. [crowd cheers] That’s how I’m living. That’s what I’m doing. Oh my God. And my husband threw me a party during the pandemic just for me. Because we found out Lenny Kravitz followed me on Instagram. [audience cheering and applauding] [cheering swells] [Michelle] What? What? Crazy, I came downstairs with streamers and balloons. My husband’s on the table, like, ♪ American woman! ♪ [audience laughing] I said, “I’m gonna suck it right off.” [audience applauding and cheering] [Michelle chuckles] [cheers subside] Happy for each other. But then Lenny Kravitz keep liking my posts. My husband went, “Do I got to worry about Lenny Kravitz?” [audience laughs] I said, “Yes, you do.” [audience cheers] “Yes, you do.” “Now clean them spoons, honey. I heard we ain’t got no clean spoons.” [audience laughs] Bitch. [laughter continues] My husband’s really into fixing stuff now. He’s like, “Let’s fix something.” I said, “I’m okay.” [scoffs] “You fix it. You tell me, I will listen.” Do you know this man came home with a chair from the garbage? [audience laughs] [audience giggles] I said, “Who this for?” [crowd laughs] [Michelle scoffs] He was like, “I was hoping we could fix it.” I said, “No, thanks.” He’s like, “I wanna fix something with you.” I’m like, “What about voter suppression?” [audience laughing] “Can we do that?” [audience cheers and applauds] We like to have fun, though. He’s really good at being high. [audience laughs] It don’t matter how much or little he has,',\n",
              "  'he’s like, “I’m cool, man.” “I’m cool. Need help? Let me help you with those bags.” Like, he’s so cool. Nothing gets to him. He’s like, “It’s okay. It happens.” I’m like, “What?” Like, me, I’m not good at being high. I want to be good at it. I am not, you know? I want… I want to serve, like, plus-size Erykah Badu, but… [audience laughs] It ain’t, it’s serving plus-size crackhead, real talk. Ooh, baby, if you ever saw me in the street high, I’m like, “I’m sorry, I’m high. Did you know I was high? Are my eyes red?” “I’m so sorry, I’m high!” [trilling] “Woo!” “Is it game night? What are we doing?” “Fold laundry? Clean the fridge? Do push-ups?” “What should we do? I am high!” “Wow!” [scattered laughing] It’s not good. It’s not a good look. My husband and I had a date night. One night, I got tickets to the Knicks game, which is a basketball team. [audience cheering] That’s right, honey. We had courtside seats. [crowd cheers] Yeah, he was very excited. I was like, “I’m good.” I was like, “I don’t know about basketball.” He’s like, “It’ll be fun.” I said, “You should go with somebody.” He’s like, “No, it’s our date night. We should go.” I’m like, “I guess.” [audience laughs] He’s like, “It’d be fun if we got high.” [audience laughing] [laughter swells] I said, “Okay.” [crowd laughing] He gave me a little piece of edible. Nothing… Nothing crazy. I didn’t feel anything 40 minutes later, so I was like, “Can I have a little more?” [audience groaning] [audience laughing] Everybody knows but me! [crowd laughs] There’s no instructions on the side. [audience laughing] [Michelle] Woo! I’ll tell you what. We got to that game, I was holding on to my chair with two hands. [audience howling] [crowd continues laughing] “Wow…” “Wow…” “Wow.” [crowd laughs] [softly] “Wow.” Like, I don’t know if you guys have ever seen a kite with freckles and big hair. [audience laughing] That was me. [crowd laughs] Like, I didn’t know if I was talking to myself out loud, or if it was an inside voice. [crowd laughs] [hoarsely] She was out here. I was like, “Wow.” I was like, ♪ Butterfly in the sky ♪ [audience cheers and laughs] ♪ I feel twice as high ♪ ♪ Take a look ♪ [audience] ♪ It’s in a book ♪ ♪ A Reading Rainbow ♪ Yeah! [audience cheers and applauds] [woman] Woo! Oh my goodness. I was nice, nice. [woman chuckles] And then the game started. [crowd laughs] [exhales] Then the paranoia set in. [audience laughs] The announcer was just so… loud. [crowd laughing] I was shook, it felt like Cloverfield. I was like… “We got to go.” He was like… [inaudible shouting] [air horn sound plays] [audience laughing] Then the players came out, I was like, “We are not safe.” [audience laughs] [laughing continues] They were so tall. [crowd laughs] It was all Adam’s apples and kneecaps. [audience laughing] They look like Sigourney Weaver as an Avatar. I was like, “No.” [audience laughing] “No, thank you.” I tried to get my husband’s attention like, [whispers] “Baby.” [straining] “Baby.” [moaning] “Baby.” [audience laughing] He’s like, “What’s up? Why you whispering?” I said, “‘Cause the players can hear me.” [audience laughing] I said, “We got to go.” He’s like, “It’s been eight minutes.” [audience laughing] I said, “I’m really sorry, but we got to go.” “I am very high.” [audience laughs] And this is why I love my husband. He’s like, “It’s okay, baby.” “Just enjoy it.” “Just enjoy the ride.” “Ride the wave.” “Taste the rainbow.” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Just focus on something, and just like it.” “Okay?” All positive vibes. He’s like, “No one can hear you.” “Anymore.” [audience laughs] And so, I actually did see a car… in the corner of the court. And this car was beautiful, the lights were on. It was, like, going around in a circle. And I was like, “That is really nice. Like… ” “I wonder who’s going to get it.” [crowd laughs] “Where do they live? What kind of life will they have?” “Are they gonna put the Christmas tree on top?” Then I asked my husband, I was like, “Baby, when do we find out who wins the car?” [audience laughs] He was like, “What?” [audience laughing] I said, “When do we find out who wins the car?” And he goes, “Baby, no one’s going to win it.” And I was like, “What?” He’s like, “It’s advertising, it’s not Family Feud, girl.” [audience laughing] And then I started to cry. [audience howling] I was like, “Life ain’t fair.” [crowd laughs] And then he’s like, “Baby, I think we should go.” I said, “I think we',\n",
              "  'should go.” [audience laughing] But can I tell y’all, as soon as we both agreed we should go, they put me on the celeb cam. [audience laughs] I didn’t know what to do, so I was just serving, like, seventh-grade talent show. What? [“Everybody Dance Now” plays] Turn it up, turn it up! ♪ Give me the music ♪ ♪ Everybody dance now ♪ That’s good. Cut it, cut it, cut it. [song stops] [audience cheering] Hit it! [“Everybody Dance Now” plays] [audience cheers and applauds] ♪ Everybody dance now ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ [audience cheers] Kill it! [audience roars] [music fades] [audience applauds] [woman] Woo! [audience laughing] Hit it! [“Everybody Dance Now” playing] [song fades] [chuckles] Oh my God. I rea– [laughing] Yo… [laughing] [audience laughs] [audience cheering and applauding] I was like a Dominican Forrest Gump. Like… [audience howling] I bachata’d my way out that fucking game. It was giving fight or flight realness. [crowd laughs] So… about that story. [laughs] [crowd laughs] That’s the last time we did a date night. [audience laughs] And that’s okay, you know, I’m… I’m a mom. I’m a working bitch. Like, I’m just tired, like… You know, once I start hitting that Viola Davis like… [panting and coughing] [crowd laughing] Give me the rosé, put me to bed. So my husband and I have actually graduated to day dates. Is anybody that old? [crowd applauds] Responsible adult. Ooh, baby. Day dates are amazing. It’s exactly what it sounds like, a date during the day. Go to a restaurant you can’t get into Saturday night on Monday afternoon. [audience laughing] You got a prix fixe menu, you taste everything for $45. [audience laughs] [Michelle laughs] Have some wine. Go home in the afternoon, sit and spin on that dick. [audience laughing] Take a shower, get the hot spots, pick the kids up from school in a good-ass mood! [crowd laughing] Oh, I’m sorry, half of y’all picking your kids up smelling like badussy? [audience laughing] [audience chuckling] Okay. [Michelle laughs] My husband surprised me with this day date and… [sighs] Yes, he is white, but this… I don’t want to say this is about race, but this is the whitest shit I’ve ever heard. Who is white here, in the front? Thank you so much. What’s your name? Pearl. Pearl? Come on. [audience laughs] Pearl? Didn’t expect you’d have the whitest, oldest name. [audience laughs] I love your grandma. Okay, Pearl. You tell me if this is white as fuck. And you got be like, “That is white as fuck.” Okay? My husband came home, and he said, “Baby, I got us two tickets to a reptile sanctuary.” [crowd laughs] Pearl. That’s white as fuck. White as fuck. Thank you. [audience laughing and applauding] So I told him, I was like, “Baby, I can’t go to a reptile sanctuary.” “That’s– that’s crazy.” He’s like, “We gotta go, the tickets were cheap.” I’m like, “You pay?” [audience laughing] “They should be paying us.” [crowd chuckling] I looked at him, I was like, “Are you the reptile guy?” “I married the reptile guy?” He’s like, “The reptile guy?” I said, “You don’t know the reptile guy?” “It’s the guy whose, like, best friends are his lizards.” “He lives with his mom for too long.” “Doesn’t have a comforter. Just got a dusty sheet, fucking monster.” [audience chucking] “His favorite movie is Scarface. He’s got the poster.” “No frame, just tacks? Yuck.” [audience laughing] “He just got fired from Jiffy Lube, he’s got a pull-up bar so his door never closes.” [crowd chuckling] “And he never wears socks ’cause they’re all crunchy around his fucking floor.” [audience laughs and groans] Don’t ask me how I know the reptile guy. This is what I’ve heard. My husband is just like, “I am not the reptile guy, but I really want to go.” And then he hit me with this European shit when he knows how to get me to do something. He’s like, “You know, it just feels like Americans stop learning in school and then never want to learn.” [audience groaning] I was like, “How dare you be so accurate?” [audience laughing] I was like, “Fine. I will go look at lizards with you.” “Because I love you.” And he goes, “You know, it might be fun if we got a little high.” [audience laughing] So I took an edible. But this time, I only took one. And it was wonderful. All you have to do is just wait two hours and 17 minutes. [crowd roaring] And it was great. I was in a good mood. Nothing was fazing me. I felt joyful. You know, I was, like, driving us to the reptile sanctuary in the Bronx in my minivan. I’m',\n",
              "  \"not proud of that sentence. [audience chuckling] In the Bronx, everyone’s got road rage. They’re, like, “Move over, bitch.” “Learn how to park.” Whatever, and I… couldn’t even care… Usually I would yell back, but I was just, like, “I hope you heal.” [audience laughing] I was like, “Being high is wonderful.” I was in the pocket. I found parking. Or did it find us? [audience laughing] [Michelle] Woo! What I didn’t expect was this to be a tour. We were with other people. They were giving, “Shoes optional at Walmart.” [audience laughing and groaning] You know? They were giving, like, third-generation January 6. [crowd chuckling and groaning] Yeah. You get it. You know, it was a lot of camouflage, but I see you. [audience laughing] [scattered applause] But I didn’t care. It was like Cowboy Carter. I was like, “This is everyone’s America.” [crowd laughing] “This ain’t Texas.” [Michelle chuckling] And it was pretty interesting. The most fascinating thing I learned about was a lizard called “the bearded dragon.” [audience laughs] It wasn’t a dragon, it was more like a plus-size lizard, I called it Lizzo. [crowd laughing] I thought it was funny, people had mixed reactions. Just trying to be body-positive. Fascinating thing about the bearded dragon is that it can change its gender. And I was like, “Okay. We’ve all had a night like that or two.” [Michelle chuckles] [crowd laughs] Oh, well, at least I have. [audience laughing and whistling] Thank you. And when we walked into the bearded dragon sanctuary, which is again, a sentence I never thought I’d say, it came right up to me, and I was like, “Okay.” And put it’s, like, little paw on the window. I said, “Oh, here we go.” Everyone’s like, “It likes you.” I’m like, “I’m a Leo. I have good energy.” [audience laughing] We’re just taking our moment, and we’re sort of mimicking each other, becoming best friends. I was there so long, I felt like that white girl in that John Travolta movie, Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Do you remember that movie? No one remembers it. Please go home and check it out. John Travolta, in the ’70s, made a movie, Boy in the Plastic Bubble, where he has an autoimmune disease. So he has to live in a plastic bubble in his house. But he has shoes on. I’m like, “Where you going, John?” [audience laughs] “Where?” A lot of holes in that story, not in the plastic bubble, anyways… So we’re just vibing, right? I’m like, “Oh my God, this is amazing.” Then its eyes start to roll back. I was like, “Go off.” [crowd laughing] And then the lizard goes, “Come here.” [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] “Yeah?” And it says, “Keep my wife’s name out your motherfucking mouth.” What? [audience roaring] They’re not even married! It was wild, and the tour guide was, like, so happy. He’s like, “She never does this. She trusts you, she loves you.” I was like, “She sure do, but honestly, right now, it’s giving they/them, okay?” [crowd laughing] Just being on the real, real. And then I heard a voice in the pack of camouflage, say… “Ah,” “You one of them woke ones?” [crowd hooting] And so, you know, I’m a little high. [audience chuckling] And I go, “What did you say?” “I couldn’t hear through your four good teeth.” [audience laughing and applauding] “What?” “What?” And she goes, “I asked you if you were a woke bitch.” [crowd gasping] I look at my husband and I go, “Did she just call me a bitch?” And he goes like this… [audience laughing] [laughter swells] And I said, “Yeah, I, Tonya.” [audience laughs and groans] “I’m one of them woke ones. What’s up?” I didn’t mean to poke the bear, but bitch, don’t come for me. Then she just started going off. She’s like, “They/them. They trying to get us to say ‘they/them’ all the time.” I was like, “Sis, you said it, like, seven times.” [audience laughing] “You could do it. You just did. It’s fine.” “Or don’t, whatever.” I was like, “Honestly, if I can be married to someone named ‘Gijs’… [crowd laughs] …you can say ‘they/them.'” [audience laughing] And then she said, “I am so tired of this bullshit phase, this non-binary, trans bullshit phase.” That’s what she said. I was like, “Look, I don’t think it’s a phase.” “Like, walking down the street, living your truth as a non-binary or trans person, while you know somebody could want to hurt you or kill you is not a phase, that’s bravery.” [audience cheers and applauds] I said, “Yo.” “Them tattooed eyebrows on your face?” [crowd laughs] “That’s a phase.” [audience laughs] “That’s not a good one. You ain’t got no friends?”\",\n",
              "  'Then she just kept coming for me. I’m like, “Am I on Fox News?” “Is this a low-budget Laura Ingraham? What…” See why I don’t want to see lizards? See what I mean? She just kept going on and on. She’s like, “But biology.” I’m like, “Spell it.” [audience laughing] She’s like, “I don’t trust what’s between their legs.” “What’s between their legs? I don’t trust what’s between their legs.” I’m like, “Why do you give a shit what’s between someone’s legs?” “You sound crazy. If you ain’t feeding, fucking, or financing, fuck off.” [audience cheers and applauds] [Michelle] “Ma’am.” She just kept going in, and I just kept trying to answer her. I blacked out. I felt like a big-titty George Jefferson. [imitating George Jefferson] “Another thing, motherfucker!” [normal voice] What am I… What am I doing? [Michelle snickering] I’m in comfy shoes to see a lizard. [crowd chuckles] There was so much hate, and I was like, “You’re very black-and-white with shit.” “I need you to live in the shades of gray where the love and humanity exists.” [audience cheering and applauding] “That’s what I need from you.” “I mean, a trans woman is no less of a woman, even if you don’t understand, okay?” “You need to love that person. That is someone’s child.” [crowd applauds] “I have children. I have twins. My body couldn’t carry them.” “We had a surrogate. I’m no less their mom.” “You understand how love works?” “Like, just open your minds.” But she kept going on, and finally, I was like, “You know what?” “I am too cute for this conversation.” I was a little high, now I’m a little sober, it’s okay. I said, “I’ll wear this outfit tomorrow ’cause people need to see it.” I walk off. And then she yelled back at me, and she said, “And to think, I was gonna tell you that I loved your sweet potato casserole recipe!” [air horn plays] [audience cheering] Thank you, guys, so much for supporting me and being a part of history tonight. I might be the first woman to do a special on this stage, but I better not be the fucking last! [audience cheers and applauds] Good night, everybody!

Wow. Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?” And I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve. Second of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?” Number three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part. The, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted\",\n",
              "  'to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just… This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.” I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?” You know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.” This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I',\n",
              "  'was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” I was like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good. So… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.” I sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t',\n",
              "  'enjoy the second halves of sentences. So then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.” As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “Me',\n",
              "  'neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.” So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.” The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?”',\n",
              "  'I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.” You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!” So we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.” I find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love. Second red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking. The final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger',\n",
              "  'red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…” Well, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.” So… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to',\n",
              "  'die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane. Even in Texas. Jenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.” And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.” So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.” At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the',\n",
              "  'tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and… I get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two,',\n",
              "  'vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub. So all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad. I’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t. The only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right. Thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much! Thanks for coming here tonight and joining me.

Do you know what I mean by that? It’s not a great thesis. It’s not profound, but legitimately, that is the closest I have come to forgiveness in my life. So for most of my life, my mom was a single parent. Five kids. No child support. We were on food stamps. When those ran out, we would dumpster dive for food. A lot of people find it hard to believe that I was ever that poor, ’cause look at this shit. [laughter] Like, not only do I look like, “Meh, everything just, like, worked out.” I look like the kind of, like, white, wealthy– I look like I was conceived in an Ivy League a capella concert. [laughter] [cheers and applause] You know what I mean? Where it is, like, that… ♪ Shimmy-doo-wop, my dad owns every university ♪ ♪ Shimmy-doo-wop, what is adversity? ♪ It’s not just rich either, right? It is, like, evil rich, right? It’s like a “Game of Thrones” King Joffrey type of rich. It looks like I found a way to monetize human suffering. I run a for-profit private prison, or even worse, I have a YouTube prank channel, where it’s like, uh, they all look like me. It’s a guy committing, like, a crime on camera. He’s like, “What is the prank, bro? What’s up? I’m Tyler, and today, we’re about to steal this old woman’s insulin.” [laughter] I grew up very poor in a big family. One summer, my two sisters, they go to this cheerleading day camp that’s discounted for low-income people, because the woman that runs it is very religious. About five minutes up the road is a boys basketball camp that I really wanted to go to. But because my mom wanted to save that little bit of money, little bit of drive time, she goes, “Oh. Why don’t you just attend the cheerleading camp with your sisters? Basically the same thing.” [laughter] Huh? No, those are two wildly different things. That’s like if you were in a restaurant, and you tried to order a Coke, and the server was like, “Actually, we don’t have Coke, but is it okay if I just frame you for arson? In my head, it’s the same thing.” 8 years old, no control over my life, I go to this cheer camp. I was like, you know what I’ll do? I’ll just lay low all summer. I won’t participate in any of the cheers. I’ll be in the back. Right? We’ve seen male cheerleaders before. They’re like the spotter. I’ll do that. Turns out, it’s pretty hard to lay low at a cheer camp when you are not only the only boy out of 37 girls, but you are also the smallest of all the girls. [laughter] Why is that important? Smallest girl in every cheer squad is what’s known as the… AUDIENCE: Flyer! The flyer. So the flyer is the delicate little angel that’s always getting tossed up in the air… [cheers and applause] …because her delicate, like, bird bones are too dangerous to support anyone and is the safest to be thrown by minors. Unprofessional minors, by the way. This isn’t like Netflix “Cheer” quality girls. This is day camp quality girls. You know what that means? Day camp? These girls don’t even have the heart and commitment to go to a sleepaway camp. They’re just stopping by at 2 p.m. to drop me on a rubber mat that’s somehow harder than the floor? Do you even want this, Marisa? Because right now you’re trying to make Nationals with a real Regionals attitude. [laughter and applause] So the whole time that I’m being… [panting and gasping] [grunts] …reluctantly tossed in the air, our cheer instructor, Mrs. Schmidt, is yelling at me, “Smile! You’re at the top of a pyramid, not the top of the cross!” [laughter] She’s very religious. Every time that the girls would drop me, which happened… all of the time, Mrs. Schmidt would have all the girls crowd around me in a semicircle, and they would all start clapping. They would go… [chanting] “Make noise, make noise. Make nose, make noise.” So not a hospital. If anything, just a way to sort of drown out any screams of pain in case the janitor comes by, like, “Nothing to see here! Business as usual!” Roll my body up in a rubber mat and then throw me into a swamp. But eventually I make it to the boys basketball camp because at the end of the summer, the big grand finale for us gals… [laughter] …is we get to go up to the boys camp– AUDIENCE MEMBER: So sad! …and cheer them–So sad. [laughter and applause] An adult that',\n",
              "  'knew they were on camera for a taping went, “So sad.” [laughter and applause] Thank you. [laughter and applause] Big grand finale for us gals is we get to go up to the boys camp and cheer them on during one of their games. So sad! [laughter and applause] Mrs. Schmidt comes to me, and she goes, “Oh, my God, so you’re gonna laugh.” I’m like, “Fuckin’ try me!” [laughter] “We ordered the uniforms at the beginning of the summer before we knew that you were gonna join us. So all we have are skirts. Don’t worry. I wouldn’t do that to you. Why don’t you just bring a pair of blue shorts from home?” I have an idea. Why don’t you just kill me right where I stand? So I walk up to this boys basketball camp in blue shorts and a top with a neckline that could only be described as not unisex, low sweeping “V,” and because of my delicate, little bird bone frame, it’s–it’s–it’s falling off the shoulder. Little tease for the boys. Ahh. Bitch, you wanna see these chocolates? Mnh-mnh! [laughter] We walk up to the boys basketball camp. Before the boys can even take the court for their game, they’re like, “Get up there! Show ’em what you learned.” We start the boys off with probably our most masculine cheer. [chanting] “All right, boys, show us what you got! Show us what you got, boys, show us what you got!” [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause continue] Now I don’t know if you’ve ever had to cheer someone on as they bully you. [laughter] But it’s a lot like if someone shot you and then it was your job to reload their gun for them. Oh, don’t worry. It gets way worse, section that’s not that into it. [laughter and applause] Fucking halftime rolls around. Now we have a cheer with participation built in. We have the cheer, goes like this. [chanting] “We got spirit! Yes, we do! We got spirit! How ’bout you?” And the boys are supposed to go, “Yeah!” And we go, “I can’t hear you!” And they go, “Yeah!” even louder. So as the flyer, I have to step right out in front. [chanting] “We got spirit! Yes, we do! We got spirit! How ’bout you?” The boys take this opportunity to yell, “You’re a cheer queer!” And then I have to chime back in with, “I can’t hear you!” [laughter and applause] [grunts] “Smile! Not the cross!” [cheers and applause] I didn’t know how to stand up for myself. I was afraid. I was. I was afraid. I didn’t know how to stand up for myself at cheer camp. A lot of fear comes from being poor. If I was doing a modern-day comedy special– you know those ones where it’s like– it’s like more like a Ted Talk than… Your friend asks you, like, “Hey, how was that comedy special? Was it funny?” And you’re like, “It was…important.” [laughter and applause] If I was doing one of those, I would make the argument that poverty is a disease on the very macro level. ‘Cause I do believe that poverty is a disease, and its most sinister symptom is fear. It’s something that I carry with me to this day. If I was doing a modern-day comedy special, I’d make the argument that yes, poverty is a disease. It’s passed down generationally just like a disease. There’s a lower life expectancy for people born below the poverty line. It’s no revelation that poverty is a major stressor, and we know that chronic stress causes damage to the cerebral cortex, the part of your brain that’s in charge of risk/reward, long-term planning. Basically all the tools that would get you out of poverty get damaged by being poor. Trying to dig yourself out of poverty in this country, it’s like trying to fix a scratch on your car by repainting it with a rake. You’ll be like… [makes squeaking sound] That’s–That’s the modern-day comedy special. I do not want to do that. I have nothing of educational value to add to your night. You won’t learn anything. I have legitimately no agenda. I just want to tell you what it feels like to be poor, and what it feels like is fear. How do you create fear in someone? Well, a good way to start is, uh, take away their stability. For most of my life, we lived in a bus. My parents moved us into a bus because I think they were trying to speed up their divorce. If you’re ever, like, with your spouse, and you’re like, “This is taking too long,” uh, move into a vehicle. ‘Cause every time I tell people that we lived in a converted bus growing up, especially in L.A., people are like, “Oh, my God. Cute. I love that for you.” Because I think you are picturing the HGTV version of a bus, where it’s like, uh, it’s like a young couple from Portland. Something’s a little off in their relationship, and they’re always like, “Hi. I’m Tracy, and my husband, also named Tracy… We fixed up this old bus because we stopped having sex, and large construction projects are the only way that I know how to make the time move.” [laughter] Those are great. Those buses are great. They’re built with time, money, and sexual frustration that crushes it into a diamond. The',\n",
              "  'bus that my parents built with no skill, no money, I would love to see an HGTV show Realtor try to sell it. You know those ones that have the kind of plastic surgery where it looks like the wind hurts? “All right, Greg, Donovan, I know you were looking for a 2-bedroom, 2-bath. Instead, I wanna show you this no-bedroom, no-bath, hot diesel tube that has more miles on it than we are currently to the sun. Immediately, you’re gonna notice this diesel smell. Uh, I don’t know how carbon monoxide leaks work. I just know that sometimes you’ll be driving, all the air will get wavy, and you’ll wake up in a new state. Uh, mountains now.” This is true. So now I have all this anxiety as an adult, all this fear around waking up and not knowing where I am. [sighs] And I travel a lot for this job. So what I will do is I will say out loud to myself whatever city and state I’m in before I fall asleep. So a couple days ago, I was in Chicago, and I was like, “I’m in Chicago. I’m in Chicago, Illinois.” Okay? Tonight I will say to myself, “I’m in Los Angeles. I’m in Los Angeles, California.” Fine. Sometimes I will forget that someone is in the bed with me. I was in Arizona, and I met this young woman after a show, and we had all of the drinks. Alcohol, uh, juice that makes you rude. And I forgot that she was in the bed next to me. So I just say out loud, “Sedona. I’m in Sedona, Arizona.” [laughter] Very comforting for me. For her, it’s the first act of the horror movie. I’m on my healing journey. She is on “The First 48.” Why does it matter if there’s fear in poor people? Well, the second you start making decisions out of fear, those are stupid decisions, right? You get backed into a corner, and a lot of times, as a poor person, you have to make those decisions, and we’ve somehow muddled that in our culture to think that, “Oh, poor people are stupid” because of these decisions. I just recently found out that I’m–am severely dyslexic and dysgraphic. Uh, it’s a very fancy way to say “illiterate.” If you’re rich in this country, and you not know read good, then automatically we’re like, “Okay, you probably have a learning disability. Let’s look into it. We’ll get you into a program. We’ll get you some Adderall,” and the parents are like, “Whoa, Adderall sounds super dangerous. Isn’t that just like cocaine?” And the government’s like, “No. Cocaine is bad. Adderall is…blue.” [laughter] [applause] And then parents are like, “Uh…that sounds good.” I guess give it to every child that even breaks eye contact. [laughter] If you’re poor and you not know read good, then we’re just like, “Oh, yeah, business as usual.” People presume that poor people are stupid so often that when a poor person is not stupid, holy shit, well, then it’s like a whole goddamn movie. It’s like a whole “Good Will Hunting” movie where the entire premise is just, “Ah! Forget aliens in space. Can you imagine a world where this piece of shit that mops the floors understood math? Give it every Oscar.” [cheers and applause] I only… I only recently found out that I’m dyslexic. If you’re not familiar with dyslexia, if you haven’t, like, read up on it, don’t worry. Neither have we. All dyslexia really means is that zero percent of the time is the book better than the movie for me. I-I have never had a movie ruin a book. I have had plenty of very confusing books cleared up thanks to dogshit movies. Thank you, “Percy Jackson.” Thank you, third “Harry Potter” movie. [cheers and applause] Not only… Not only did people think I was stupid growing up, but, uh, adults like yourself all the time would come up to me and ask if I was, in fact, a little lady person. I was a very late bloomer. I didn’t really hit puberty until… hopefully next year. [laughter] I was very free with my wrists as a kid, just like two wet American flags in the sun, and I walked on my toes. I walked on my toes for some reason. So in combination, I-I… I walk like how bells sound. [laughter] [tune of “Carol of the Bells”] ♪ Bing-ba-da-bing ♪ ♪ Bing-ba-da-bing, bing-ba-da-bing ♪ And to make matters even worse, I had this shoulder length long, blond hair. My mom did not know how to cut hair. She was too cheap to pay someone to cut it. So she’s like, “You know what? I’ll just make it exactly like my hair but a little bit shorter, and then that’ll be for boys,” and it’s not. It is the Lizzie McGuire. In fact, it’s this right here. [audience gasps] Oh, God! Oh, God! [cheers and applause] Notice the low swooping necklace to accommodate for the puka shell necklace. Remember when you wanted a meth head’s teeth around your neck? “Now…why is it this glowing, platinum blond? You’re not blond now.” Well, this is true. My mom dyed all five of her kids blond because she didn’t want anyone knowing that she herself was not a natural blonde. [laughter] [applause] Holy shit. Show’s over. Even a serial killer on the run from the law would',\n",
              "  \"be like, “That’s too much. I’ll do the time.” Oh. I was talking to my mom about this, just setting up the special, fact-checking everything, and she goes, “Well, I didn’t just dye your guys’ hair blond for–for–for my sake. I also dyed it blond because we were about to be evicted from a 1-bedroom apartment, and I wanted to make all you five kids look like one kid.” [laughter] [scoffs] That’s worse! That’s way worse! [scoffs] Never, never defend yourself in court. “Your Honor, how could I have committed that hit-and-run when I was across town committing a murder?” [laughter] I look so much like a little lady person. I was once kicked out of a men’s restroom. At 13, I was at an Outback Steakhouse with my mom, not to eat but to steal toilet paper. [laughter] I was always too afraid to steal because I saw my mom constantly get caught. She was a terrible shoplifter. And one time she tried to steal bottles of vitamins from a grocery store. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to steal bottles of vitamins before, but it’s a lot like trying to steal maracas. [laughter] Chh-chh! Chh-chh-chh. Chh-chh! And then she would be surprised when she got caught. “How did they know?” I’m gonna guess they were tipped off by the quinceañera you have going on in your purse. [cheers and applause] I was kicked out of a men’s restroom at 13, Outback Steakhouse with my mom. One of the customers comes in right after me, and he goes, “Whoa! What are you doing? The women’s restroom is the next door over, sweetie.” Okay. We’ve all established what I looked like. But also, at this point, I was already standing at the urinal. [laughter] Well, what did he think I was doing? [laughter] [grunting] Try to…cup it and splash it in? And if I do get it in there, why don’t you let a girl dream? I’m over here, trying to shatter the porcelain ceiling. [laughter] I definitely know I was supposed to be a rich piece of shit because the thing that bothered me the most was the terms for poor people. So if you’re on food stamps like we were, you were called a “food-insecure household.” I never liked that, ’cause “food-insecure”– it… [sighs] it’s too emotional of a word. It just makes, like, a pretty serious issue just sound adorable, like it’s in our heads, like the government’s like, “Oh, come on! Show us your food. Show us.” And I’m like… [laughter] Mnh-mnh. “Come on, show– go and show us that…” Look, I need carbs, not confidence. But it makes us feel better if we can make a systemic issue sound psychological, then it’s like, “I don’t have to deal with it. They can just pull themselves up.” If you’re on food stamps, they don’t call it “food stamps” anymore. Now it’s called SNAP– Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. “SNAP” just sounds like an off-off-off Broadway production of “STOMP,” the musical. “Can’t afford brooms. Don’t wanna get sued. So just snap.” A woman came up to me after a show who essentially looked like if an NPR tote bag was a person. And she was like, “Okay, so– so you were homeless growing up, but you shouldn’t say that you were homeless. It’s, like, derogatory. You should say that you were ‘unhoused.'” And I’m like, “Oh, yeah, sorry I bummed you out with my own personal experience.” [laughter and applause] I think it’s just like it’s these half-measures that we do to make ourselves feel better. “Unhoused” doesn’t even make sense. I get that it’s the polite thing to say, but it doesn’t make sense. “Homeless” makes sense. We had a home, and then we had less. “Unhoused”–that sounds like another HGTV show. “Tracy and Tracy realized that the bus wasn’t their problem. The problem was Tracy.” “I’ve tasted a gun before. I didn’t pull the trigger, but it hit one of my fillings, and I liked it.” [laughter] “So now they’re trying to get unhoused.” [laughter] You can’t buy everything you want on food stamps, right? And even when we would buy things that are not, like, food stamp-approved, we would still get the shitty poor person version of it. Anytime we wanted ice cream, my mom would buy us that giant, clear value bucket of ice cream. Did you ever get those? You know what I mean? [cheers and applause] Where, like, you read it, it’s like too cheap to even be a real flavor? You read it, it’s like, “We got white, and we got darker white!” What’s darker white? Is that supposed to be vanilla bean? Why are there pinto beans in there? And this is true. My mom only bought us that ice cream bucket because she wanted the actual bucket. At Walmart, a mopping bucket costs $6.99. Value bucket filled with ice cream–$4.99. It was cheaper than an empty bucket. [laughter] Do you know how shitty your ice cream has to be to actually depreciate the value of an empty bucket? You’ll be all, “I don’t want that bucket if that ice cream’s even touched it. It might ruin my dirty mop water.” [laughter] Now the truth about food stamps is it’s a broken system. You pay too much for it as a taxpayer. Also, for the families that are on it, it’s not enough. You always run out of food stamps. So what\",\n",
              "  'most families do is they, one, just won’t eat when they run out, or they’ll go to a food bank and get the dented cans. [sighs] It is… I’ll get off it, but it did seem suspicious that all of the cans were dented. All of them? It’s like, are they doing that? Or how are you guys shopping? You’re like, “What is this? Low-sodium corn?” “Get out of here!” [laughter and applause] If you don’t wanna do that, you don’t want the pandering programs, you can take a little agency over your life. Yeah, it’s humiliating, but you can dumpster dive for food. Whatever the grocery store throws out that’s expired or is about to expire, we would take that and… [sighs] I just hated my job dumpster diving. I-I had to be the lookout. I was the smallest, so I couldn’t be in the cool-ass dumpster with my siblings. I had to be the lookout. Like, that’s the worst job in a heist movie. I’m not even the lookout for something cool like cash or diamonds. I’m the lookout for garbage, something we’ve all unanimously decided we do not want to look at. So there’s no job. Every once in a while, a car would drive by, and then I would just be out front, just… [laughter and applause] The face of dumpster diving– really, the flyer of dumpster diving. [chanting] E., E. coli, E., E., E. coli! [cheers and applause] That’s what people wanna know. That’s the next question, right? Did we ever get sick eating from the dumpster? Of course. When I was 9 years old, we were living in this really terrible part of Florida called Florida and… [laughter] Ha ha, no one’s ever made that joke before. [laughter] Anytime we wanted to go swimming, we couldn’t afford our own pool, what we would do is we would break into a condo community or an apartment complex, or even a country club in an upscale area, pretend we lived where you live so we could use your pool. Some of you know this as a crime. We were about to break into the nicest pool in Florida– Bluewater Bay. Only downside of Bluewater Bay is they had a shit-ton of security to the point where it made me mad how much security there was. There was a guard shack security guard, a roaming security guard, and just a pool security guard. My mom was all about doubling up, not just cheer camp and basketball camp. So she was like, “Okay, we’re gonna drive all the way out to this nice neighborhood. First, we’re gonna stop off at their grocery store dumpster, see what these richies are throwing out.” [laughter] I had never seen anything like it. This grocery store’s freezers went down, so they threw out their entire ice cream department at once. Every kind of name-brand non-bucket ice cream is now in three large blue trash bags sitting in this dumpster– Hershey’s, Klondike, whatever the fuck sherbert is supposed to be. My four siblings and I, we waste no time, right there, back of the store, just start shoveling half-melted ice cream into our face as fast as possible, just like little raccoons before this all melts. [laughter] And I feel that judgment from the crowd. “Gross! You’re gonna eat dumpster ice cream?” Yeah. It’s ice cream. Do you know how good ice cream is? Ice cream is so good, it’s the only food that all of us in this room will willingly eat out of a stranger’s windowless van. [laughter and applause] And we’re excited about it! Oh, yay! It’s the ice cream man! Send the kids alone! Surely that’ll be safe. He is only playing the world’s scariest clown music. Dressed in all white. What kind of pervert dresses in all white? [laughter] [cheers and applause] So my four siblings and I waste no time. We polish off three large trash bags of ice cream between the 5 of us in under 15 minutes. I don’t know if you’ve ever had to speed-eat dairy in the sun. [laughter] We are not doing well. Have you ever been– have you ever been so full that you feel it in your neck? [gulps] Ahh. It’s like every burp is so high stakes. Every–Every burp is a contraction for the barf baby that you’re about to deliver. Like, it’s kicking. It has a pulse. Like, if I lived in Texas right now, it’d be illegal to throw this up. [cheers and applause] [imitates Southern accent] “That baby’s a person there. I’ll snitch on you.” [applause] So my mom, thank God, being the one adult in this whole situation, gets a look at us and is like, “Okay, you guys do not look well, so pool day… is still definitely on. I’m not driving back this way again. Rally. Let’s go.” I get to this pool. It is packed with other families. So all the security guards are out– the guard shack security guard, the roaming security guard, and just the pool security guard. My mom is like, “Okay, look at me. Look at me. Don’t freak out. Just stick with the regular plan of breaking into one of these pools. Every kid spreads out as far as possible. One by one, you enter the pool from different sides. When it’s safe, you can meet in the middle. We’re not gonna flash mob people with poverty.” [laughter] But the',\n",
              "  'second that I jump in on my side of the pool, I know that I’m gonna vomit. [laughter] so my plan is to just put my mouth under the water so it won’t make a sound, and then just… [imitates vomiting] So–So much. It looked like I had eaten nothing but 700 vanilla lava lamps. The amount that came out was just like, oh, my God. I think I figured out how they make darker white. This kid with red hair– he comes to the surface of the pool, and he goes, “Oh, my God!” Because he has a full IMAX 3-D experience below. That causes my older brother Jonah, who was already… [gags] not doing well– he turns–he sees me, and then he starts vomiting. Because vomiting is a lot like those inspirational quotes that white girls will post online– very contagious and embarrassing when it slips out of your mouth in public. So he just starts… [gags] “If you can’t handle me at my worst, you don’t deserve me at my best.” That triggers my two sisters over here to just… [gags] “Shoot for the moon. You might land amongst the stars.” And then finally, my older brother David just… [imitates vomiting] “If you want a rainbow, you’re gonna have to put up with some rain.” So now… [cheers and applause] There are five kids simultaneously inspiring the shit out of one pool, which turns out is way too many kids to be throwing up at once. I know that because the other parents at this pool are now freaking the fuck out. Because we are all so far spread out in this pool, it doesn’t look like some isolated incident. In their minds, it looks like some sort of violent supervirus has swept over the entire pool, causing kids to explode. Kids are screaming. Parents are pulling their kids out by the arms. There’s kids throwing up that didn’t even eat trash bags of ice cream. Fuck is your excuse? [cheers and applause] I get out of the pool. The entire pool is ruined. And I remember just thinking to myself, “Man…this place needs better security.” [laughter] [cheers and applause] I think the common misconception is that everyone on food stamps is just sitting around, waiting to collect a welfare check and ruining pools. In my personal memory, my mom was always in this constant manic state to provide for us– all these schemes that we’d end up losing more money on, than if she just got a minimum wage job. My earliest memory of this is in 1992, Bob Saget came on TV and introduced a show called “America’s Funniest Home Videos.” On this show, if you’re familiar, people would send in, like, their amateur tapes of, like, bloopers on a home video. Someone fell down. Someone’s playing wiffle ball and got hit in the nuts. At the end of the show, the funniest video would– it’s a very exciting show if you haven’t seen it, ’cause they–they control the video. It’s like watching someone else watch YouTube. [laughter] End of the show, the funniest video would win 10 grand. Uh, and then Bob Saget would, like, do– This is not–this probably won’t make the special, but just for you guys, um… [chuckles] I was rewatching it to, like, prep for this, and for some reason, all of Bob Saget’s improv– he would, like, do… [nasal voice] Ah. [normal voice] …voices over the clips– it was all just about his grandma to the point where I’m like, like, some kid would get, like, you know, pulled out of frame, like, “This kid got yanked harder than my grandma.” Like… I’m worried about– like, in a real way, I’m worried about his grandma. [laughter and applause] So most people heard this concept of “America’s Funniest Home Videos,” and they were like, “Oh, that’s a fun way to pass the time in between Fentanyl doses.” [laughter] My mom heard this, and she took it as a direct and personal job offer. “Okay, Bob Saget, I will make you this funny video that you require. You will give me your 10 grand.” Every single weekend, we would rent a camera, two 6-hour tapes, and we would shoot fake, staged bits in the hopes of scamming the show out of 10 grand. Usually it’s like a happy accident, like, whoa, hit in the nuts. But my mom was like, “No, we can engineer this. We’re gonna do highbrow non-nut humor.” One day, she gets an idea that’s gonna win us the 10 grand. Here’s the bit. All of us kids are gonna be in the kitchen, making cookies, right? And halfway through, 2-year-old Moses… Huh…is going to accidentally drop an egg off of the countertop–whoops– and it’s gonna land on my sister’s head, who is sitting just below. Judging by this audience’s response, it’s a killer bit. [laughter] Anyone that’s silent is going, “How come I didn’t think of that? Egg on the head. Egg on the face.” Two things are standing in my mom’s way between her and the 10 grand. The first is that her very young children do not understand this bit at all. No concept of, like, a joke, a prank, or pretend. A lot of us do with number two. She was a very strict, religious parent that we were a little afraid of. So when she told my 2-year-old brain, “Hey, you’re supposed to accidentally–” Oxymoron– “…drop',\n",
              "  'an egg on your sister’s head,” my brain exploded. I was like, “This is some kind of trap. Why is this being filmed? You’ve been telling me my entire life not to throw eggs around like we got egg money.” [laughter] So… what we’re about to watch right now is the many outtakes… [cheers and applause] …that it took to get this very dumb video, and, uh, before we start it, just a heads up. The video has all the charm and production value of, like, a hostage video. So… I am here in the overalls as she explains this bit to me. [beep] [beep] Hi! Hi! Hi, Grandma and Grandpa. We’re gonna make you a video. Yeah! We’re starting off this morning by, um, making you some cookies. [beep] [mixer whirring] No, today on the tape, we’re gonna play, uh, uh, we’d–we’d go outside, and next we would–we– we’d play even when– we’d–we’d play outside we have a swing set out there, too. Do it again. Okay. [beep] Hi, Grandma and Grandpa. Hi, Grandma and Grandpa. We’re making a tape today. [mixer whirring] [audience laughing] [beep] [beep] Hi, Grandma and Grandpa. Hi! [mixer whirring, speaks indistinctly] Yeah. [beep] [beep] At this point, my mom had come to her senses, like all of us in this room and realized what the problem was. The egg is too small. [laughter] Let’s up the visual stakes with a large bag of flour. So now all they have to do is just knock over a bag of flour. And we’re gonna send it to you in the mail. Okay, honey, do– okay, do it again. [beep] A little beyond, but– Oh! [mixer whirring] Ow! [beep] Stop, stop. [beep] Hi, Grandma and Grandpa! Hi, Grandma and Grandpa! Now we’re gonna send it to you in the mail. [baby cries] Wait, stop. Just blown the entire bit. Don’t say that. We’re acting. Oh. [beep] Hi, Grandma and Grandpa! Hi, Grandma and Grandpa! Hi! Hi! [mixer whirring, indistinct conversations] [beep] Just do it, Moses. [beep] [speaks indistinctly] [beep] [beep] Hi, Grandma and Grandpa. So I’ve been recast in the video. Chocolate chip. Yeah, chocolate chips. David! [beep] [beep] [faucet runs] [beep] Okay, let’s do it. [beep] Here we go. Yeah, we’re gonna make you a lot of cookies. [indistinct conversations] Grandma, Grandma, Grandpa. You can help. You can help. David. [bleep] Hi, Grandma and Grandpa! Hi! We made you some cookies. Yeah, chocolate chip. [beep] David, just do it! [beep] Can I help? Can I help? Yep, we can all help. Let me get you a cup. Damn it. Do it! Not now. [beep] [cheers and applause] Do it again? [all speak at once] [beep] [all shouting at once] Yeah, flour. [speaks indistinctly] Ohh! Mommy, that was fast. [giggling] [cheers and applause] So now the question is, did we ever win the 10 grand? No. But we did get featured in the cold open of season 3, the very beginning, and for that, we received a $200 appearance fee. So if you add up all the camera rentals, time spent, we made a net profit of $652, and this is how the clip actually aired on the show with Bob Saget’s narration over it. Come see why we’re making it. This is what we did. SAGET: These kids cook just like my grandmother used to– a pinch of this, a bag of that, ♪♪♪ Now… [cheers and applause] I only showed you that again because that was a shit-ton of takes to get a very dumb bit, right? It gets way worse. I don’t think you understand how much she believed in this idea. How the clip aired on the show– she’s wearing what color pants? AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: White! AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Blue! She’s wearing blue pants on the show, but in every take I had shown you before then– Will you press “play”? Every take I showed you before then, she’s wearing white pants, meaning there’s an entirely different reshoot day I don’t even have time to show you tonight. That’s how deep this goes. [cheers and applause] It’s very tacky to say how much you’re being paid for your HBO Max special. What I will say is that as of tonight, it took about– well, over 20 years, but eventually, from this bit, my mom made the 10 grand. [cheers and applause] A lot of people will watch that video and they’ll ask me if I’m mad at my mom. No. The older I get, the more I understand what she was going through. Now that I’m old enough to have my own kids, and by that, I mean, pregnancy scares… [laughter] I can–I can understand what she’s going through. Now understanding why someone does a behavior is also not an excuse for that behavior. There is–There is an ocean between apathy and empathy, between approval and just forgiveness. My mom displayed a lot of crazy behavior growing up. That crazy behavior was a way to combat the fear. Crazy beats scary. If your day-to-day problems are the insane decisions that you yourself have created, then you feel like you have some sort of agency over your life. I got myself into this. I can get myself out. And then you don’t have to focus on the larger fear that you’re a single parent, and you’re completely alone. And the older you get, the idea of hustling and grinding starts fading into failure, and you understand',\n",
              "  'that the idea of upward mobility in this country–it’s a lie. It’s a lie because stories like mine get elevated in our culture– these stories of rags to riches, from the dumpster to HBO Max. Because these stories– they make us feel good. These make us feel good. They allow us to continue to do nothing about the unfathomable amount of poverty that is just beyond these walls. And my story is not the truth. The truth is that most people are born poor, and they die even poorer. Sure, I worked my ass off to get here in front of you tonight. But I also got very lucky. I got lucky that people took a chance on me. I got lucky that you physically came out tonight, and I don’t say this because I have any agenda or there’s any actual steps. I am only saying that I got lucky, because that is what I needed to hear as a poor kid, when I was knee-deep in a dumpster and head high in shame– “Some people get lucky.” When I was at cheer camp, and they did a lot worse than just say, “Hey, you’re a cheer queer”– “Some people just get lucky.” Now imagine you’re a single parent, and you’re not as lucky. You’re in charge of five human beings that are supposed to have a better life than you. If that doesn’t scare you, I don’t know what will. Crazy beats scary. The crazy behavior was a way to combat fear. The first time I understood that crazy beat scary was on the very literal level. I was 18. I had my very first girlfriend, and Mandy was way out of my league. Mandy was cool. Mandy had these black bangs, thick black eyeliner. She basically looked like… [sighs] like if a person just walked into a Hot Topic, looked around once, and was like, “I’ll take it.” [laughter] I, on the other hand, was 18, 85 pounds. I looked like I walked into a Build-A-Bear so I could get a vest in my size. [laughter] And the type of guys that Mandy was used to dating were the type of guys that people would just look at and be like, “Oh, man, that guy looks dangerous.” People would look at me, like, they look at, like, you and I, will be like, “Oh, man. That guy looks ticklish.” [laughter] I was also a very sensitive teenager. Very sensitive. Mandy was the strong one. I was very sensitive. A couple months before I met Mandy, I was going through a really bad breakup. I was going out with this girl for six months, and we both got to that point in our relationship where we decided that she should break up with me. [laughter] Very confusing time for both of us, ’cause she was like, “What are you talking about? We were never actually really together.” I’m like, classic us. [laughter] I was very chill about the breakup. I cried every single day for 33 days. I know that because I wrote that in a journal, and I sent it to her. [laughter] Emotionally abusive. So I was doing a lot of crying, you know. My older brother–he caught me crying in our shared room, this breakup, and he goes, verbatim, he goes… [scoffs] “Wow. Guess you’re the world’s biggest little bitch.” I was like, “Uh, actually, that’s an oxymoron. How can I be the world’s biggest and the world’s li–” Before I could finish “little,” he had already punched me in the neck. [laughter] So now anytime I wanted to cry, I would now have to drive to my cry spot. Uh, whoops! That is as lame as it sounds. [scoffs] A designated area I would physically drive my 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse to to just go and cry, save up things that would happen during that week. [voice breaking] Be like, not now. Save it. File. Save As. “Saddest Moment of My Life-Final.” “File already exists named ‘Saddest Moment of My Life-Final.’ Do you want to replace?” Yes. [normal voice] And then once a week, drive out to this half-abandoned cul-de-sac, park my car, and unload in this tantrum cry. You ever been crying so hard, you’re, like, about to throw up? Like, your vomit sees your tears come out. It’s like, “Me, too.” I’m that level of like… [moans and gags] I see a cop car speed by the main road. The tires screech out, and it peals back around. I’m like, “Okay, well, that’s not for me.” I mean, shoo-bee-doo-wop, what is adversity? Before I know it, that cop car is now nose to nose with my car. And the cop gets over the loudspeaker, and he goes… [sighs] “All right, let’s break it up, lovebirds.” [gasps and laughter] I look up. All of my windows are fogged up from my sadness. When I cry, I’m a squirter. [laughter] But from his perspective, it looks like two human beings are in here, like à la “Titanic,” like doing sex on each other. So now I have to step out of the car and deliver the world’s saddest sentence. And he goes, “Break it up, lovebirds.” I step out of the car, still crying. I’m like… [gulps] [voice breaking] “No, it’s just one bird in here.” [laughter and applause] There’s just…one bird… in here. [laughter] This very tough veteran cop, like the kind of cop who has seen',\n",
              "  'the worst of the worst over the course of his career– homicides, overdoses and he’s kind of tough where it looks like not only has he never let himself have an emotion, but it looks like he buys his jeans at Costco. He gets one look at me crying in his light, and he goes… [gasps] “Oh, God. Sorry.” [laughter] He turns away. Do you know how profoundly lame/white you have to look for a cop to ignore all of his training and turn his back to the perp to be like, “I don’t even care if you have a gun. Jesus Christ. Just end it for us both”? [applause] Without saying another word, he gets back into his car, and he speeds off, shook, like, visibly shook. I would like to think that later that night, that cop–he’s at a diner with all of his veteran cop buddies, exchanging different horror stories. One cop is like, “I’ll never forget 2003. 18-car pileup, body parts everywhere.” And they finally get to my cop. “John, you all right? You haven’t said a word all night.” And my cop is just in the corner. He’s in the corner trembling, smoking an unlit cigarette. [laughter] He looks up at them and goes, “I didn’t think it was possible, but tonight I met the world’s biggest little bitch.” [laughter and applause] And then the last cop– the last cop, he goes, “Oh, you think that’s bad? I’ll never forget 1999. Before I joined the force, I was a security guard at a pool, and a violent supervirus swept over.” [cheers and applause] [cheers and applause continue] Mandy and I did have a lot in common. We both had very strict, religious parents. Like, Mandy’s mom is the kind of religious where as we speak, her bedroom walls are covered in the most gruesome photos of Jesus being crucified. Just like–or–or paintings. Sorry. Uh, right, not pho– That would be insane. There’s like a watermark. It’s like, 2008? What the fuck? [laughter] Paintings, renderings, and, like, shit that’s so raw, like Mel Gibson would be like, “Yikes. That looks anti-Semitic.” And here’s what gets me. They’re not even in frames. These photos are just hastily pasted up and down her walls, almost like she’s trying to solve Jesus’ murder. “Everyone thinks it’s Pontius Pilate and Judas, right? Everyone thinks it’s Pontius Pilate and Judas, but no one–no one’s talking about John the Baptist!” [laughter] “Why was he in Sedona? Sedona, Arizona.” [laughter] So the only place that we could ever hook up was the back seat of my car. Uh, I don’t know if you’ve ever had car sex. It’s not great. Also, you’re 18. We remember that time with rose-colored glasses, like…eh! It’s the worst sex you’re having of your life. [laughter] This is why I’ve never understood the male fantasy of wanting to hook up with a virgin. I mean it. I don’t get it. Like, why is that good? There’ll be those guys that’ll come to me, and they feel very comfortable saying, “I hooked up with this chick. Virgin.” Gross. Why is that good? Sex has to be the only time where inexperience is desired. I couldn’t convince you guys to go to a concert tonight and be like, “Oh, my God. You have to go to the Hollywood Bowl. There’s this girl. She has… never played guitar before.” [laughter] “She’s gonna learn as she goes.” Like, that sounds awful. Will she at least be enjoying herself? “No, she’s actually gonna be in a lot of pain.” [laughter] People actually show up to this? “Actually, most guys will come early.” [laughter] [cheers and applause] I don’t mean to put it on her. I was the worst person that you could lose your virginity to. I’d stolen my older sister’s “Cosmopolitan” magazine. “Seven tips to drive your partner wild.” Boom, these are going in the arsenal. To drive your partner wild, you are su– This was what they published. To drive your partner wild, you are supposed to kiss around their jawline as you softly hum. [laughter] So… [laughter continues] ♪ Hmm-mm ♪ [smooches] ♪ Mmm-mm ♪ I did this to a real human woman that I had no intention of murdering. [laughter] And we would never park the car in places like Make-out Point in the fear that our parents would catch us. Too obvious. We’d always go way out to a desolate road or an abandoned parking lot. It’s a longwinded way to basically say I would take Mandy to my former cry spots. [laughter] Yeah. She was like, “How’d you find this place?” I’d be like, “No more questions.” [laughter] I had learned from my crying experience that that these types of locations– they draw a lot of attention from the cops. If they see a car parked in the middle of nowhere, they’re gonna investigate. They’re gonna break us up. So it was like, okay, I’m gonna do something so the cops don’t break us up. I invented this very real thing that Mandy affectionately named “junk blanket.” [sighs] Stay with me. I have a replica. Let me show you. So…what junk blanket was… [sighs] was an unzipped sleeping bag that I had personally hand-sewn, mostly duct-taped a bunch of old clothes to the outside of. This way, when the cops would pull up on our car and shine the light through the window, I could just pull the junk blanket',\n",
              "  'over Mandy and myself, cop would look through the window and think, “Oh, there’s just a pile of junk back there… that happens to be steaming. On with my patrol.” So one night, Mandy and I were out in our favorite desolate road. There’s not a car in a mile in each direction. There’s no streetlights, just the stars. And we’re in the back seat, having the worst sex of our lives. [laughter] ♪ Mmm-mm ♪ Halfway through, 30 seconds in… [laughter] [cheers and applause] …this car pulls up right behind us. Just the headlights are shining through the back window. I’m like, “Oh, shit. That’s the cops.” I pulled junk blanket from the hatchback of my car over Mandy and myself. As the cops get out, they’re talking to each other, and it starts to sound a lot less like cops and a lot more just like four sketchy guys that mean to do us or this car some kind of harm. I completely freeze in this situation. This is not gonna go well for me, unless there’s some sort of tickle-off, I’m not gonna win this fight. The only saving grace is that we’re safe inside the car. They tried to open the driver’s side door. It’s locked. My heart begins to race. Mandy’s eyes begin to well with tears, makes all that black mascara run. And then it’s completely silent except for the sound of metal scraping on concrete. I peek my head over junk blanket, and just over my head, boom, a metal shovel comes through the driver’s side window, spraying glass everywhere. We are no longer safe. They are inside the car. And it quickly dawns on me that they have no idea that we’re inside the car. They thought the car was abandoned. They were gonna steal the radio, whatever valuables were inside. Junk blanket has worked too well. So now we need to do something. We need to do something just to make our presence known, like, hey, human beings are in here, and Mandy is just looking at me like, “Aren’t you gonna do something?” And I’m looking at Mandy. “Aren’t you gonna do something?” So I am trying to say to these guys, “What do you want from us?!” [laughter] But…I am so scared, the only thing that can come out of my body is this mixture of, like, half breath, half just a fear sound. So now it’s this barely audible, just… [breathily] “What do you want? [mumbling] What do you want from us? [grunts] [mumbling] What do you want from us?” And it’s so frustrating. It feels like a bad dream, like your mouth is moving, but no sound is coming out. I need to do something at this point just to make some kind of sound, and I think back to cheer camp. [laughter] [chanting weakly] “Make noise, make noise.” And before I know it, I am outside the vehicle, and I get to look at one of these guys in the face for the first time, and they look more scared than I do. I realize now what they are seeing. My face is now covered in Mandy’s running black mascara. I am butt-naked, except for a baggy green condom, clapping at these guys on a desolate road, going, [muttering] “What do you want from us?! What do you want from us?! What do you want from us?! What do you want from us?! What the fuck do you want from us?!” [cheers and applause] They are so freaked out. They are so freaked out. They get back in their car, and they speed off, because crazy beats scary! [loud cheers and applause] Thank you so much! This is fantastic. [cheers and applause continue] ♪♪♪ Part two.

Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up. So… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes. Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessarily the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go, “Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers',\n",
              "  'and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete, he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!” So, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we’re so close, than for a man to turn into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one',\n",
              "  'I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life on Earth. You don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took 45 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay',\n",
              "  'for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would! I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.” I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Great. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I',\n",
              "  'go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long. Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit? So… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like a holiday, flying to the States. I could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying',\n",
              "  'that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes, but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right? That’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28, proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t… burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d',\n",
              "  'embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh,',\n",
              "  'Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead? But… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an atheist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks! So… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context, it’s about content. What do you mean by',\n",
              "  'a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said, “Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play on words, that don’t really mean anything.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes, they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go. That’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it. I should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!” And there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw',\n",
              "  'answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this time, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went, “Fucking brilliant, mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went, “Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night!

[tuning] [gentle Hawaiian music playing over radio] [revving] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise for Ronny Chieng! [crowd cheering] [upbeat music playing] [crowd continues cheering] [music fades] Thank you. Thank you, Hawaii! I’m turning 38, so I’m harvesting my wife’s eggs this year. I’m harvesting my wife’s eggs so that we can make embryos, so we can freeze the embryos, so that we do not have to have kids right now because kids are what you have when you’ve given up on your own hopes and dreams. [crowd laughing] I’m still trying here! I look at my friends who are my age who have kids, and they all look like shit. [crowd laughing] It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even take a photo with them and post it on my main grid because it messes up the aesthetics of my Instagram too much. With their fucking haggard faces. Just drooping, wrinkly crow’s-feet-embedded heads. Receding hairlines. Just withering, graying hair coming out in clumps. Because of their children. Like, I did a show, and someone I went to high school with in Singapore came to the show, and after the show, I met up with them, and they brought another person with them, and I was like, “Oh, is this other person your mom?” “Thank you so much for bringing your mother to my show.” And that other person was also someone I went to high school with. [crowd laughing] That’s how fucking ugly… [crowd laughing] …these people have become because of their children. Just unrecognizable. So I’m trying to use money and science to push the curve back a little bit. And, um, first step of harvesting my wife’s eggs is, I have to inject my wife twice a day for two weeks. So, I have to inject my wife. I am the one injecting my wife twice a day for two weeks. Zero medical training. I was given no medical training whatsoever. The government lets you do this. The… The doctor asked me to do it. The doctor was like, “Hey, have you ever held a needle before?” “No? Perfect, here, take this, and inject your wife in the middle of her body, like Nicolas Cage in The Rock.” [crowd laughing] “Twice a day for two weeks with chemicals that we mail to you.” “Mystery chemicals that we send to your house in unmarked brown boxes.” “Just trust us that it’s the right thing that you’re injecting into the person you love the most.” Internet chemicals that show up… It comes in a powder! I have to make it into a liquid, you understand? It’s a meth lab in my kitchen as I’m mixing… the comp… I’m sweating the whole time ’cause I’m scared I’ll fuck up the measurements and kill my wife with these powerful pharmaceuticals that you dissolve it in distilled water completely, then you have to, like… The air bubbles are fucking up the micro millimeter measurements. And then you have to put it in the syringe. Then you have to flick the needle with a positive attitude like you know what you’re doing. [crowd laughing] [scattered applause] I don’t know what I’m doing! I saw someone do this on Doogie Howser. [crowd laughing] [crowd whooping] I don’t even know the angle to put it into her. [chuckling] Like, it looks so painful going in, like… I love my wife so much I can’t even bear to watch her in pain. I couldn’t even bear to watch the needle go into her. I had to inject my wife like this. I had to, like, cover my eyes, and, like, backhand it… [crowd laughing] …into her like Kurosawa. [imitates sword slash] “Did I get the middle of your body?” “No?” “Okay, just walk into the needle!” [crowd laughing] “I’m supposed to do all the work here? Meet me halfway.” And, uh, the doctor said, “If you do everything right, if you… measure correctly, you inject at the right times, they scan, like, this part of her body, you know, that Chicago Bulls logo. Right? And they were like… [crowd laughing] …”If you do everything right, based on what we can tell, you should expect 15 eggs.” [inhales] And my wife ended up getting 26. [scattered whooping and applause] Yeah. Always a… [applause] Yeah, always like a late, half-hearted response to… [crowd laughing] Usually, the women in the crowd are like, “Whoo, yeah.” All the men in the crowd are always like… [crowd laughing] “Is that a good number?” “Is 26 a good number of eggs?” “How many eggs equal one bebe?” “Is it four eggs is one bebe?” “So 26 eggs is six and a half bebes if you squish it together…” Let me put this in a language that men can understand, okay? Twenty-six eggs from one vagina, in one cycle, is MVP numbers. [crowd laughing] Twenty-six eggs is like, if Magic Johnson averaged the triple-double and killed his own AIDS. [crowd laughing] Okay? That’s the level of medical miracle that’s happening in whatever this part of my wife’s body, that horn of the bull that, like, curls into itself. The doctor, like, scraped out 26 eggs out of my wife’s\",\n",
              "  'vagina, like salmon roe. Just scooping out. Just dripping out, and then you put it in some nigiri, right? And then you eat it. That’s how babies are made. You gotta Salt Bae the eggs onto the ikura, and then you eat it. So, uh, we’re trying to make embryos. So, eggs, that’s just half the equation. I don’t know if you know how embryos are made, but eggs, that’s just half of it. She did her part admirably. So now I have to contribute my half of the embryo equation. So I’m sitting in the doctor’s office. [exhales] Like a wet pigeon, all right? And the doctor comes over. And the doctor’s a woman because of course she is. She’s like, “Good morning, Mr. Chieng.” “So, um, when’s the last time you ejaculated?” My wife is right here, and she’s like, “Yeah, when is the last time you ejaculated?” [crowd laughing] “We would all like to know.” It’s the one time in life where you’re not allowed to lie about jerking off. It’s when a medical professional is asking you a direct question. And it’s for reproduction. It’s for the intended purpose, so you gotta tell the truth. So I’m like, “Whatever, I’ll tell the truth.” “Uh, let me check my calendar, uh…” [crowd laughing] “I guess the last time I ejaculated was, um…” “Let me see… Uh, yesterday, around 3:00 p.m.” [crowd laughing] And my wife is like, “Yesterday… I was with you all day.” [crowd laughing] And I was like, “Yeah, but remember when you took out the trash?” [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Because I also put up MVP numbers. Against a shot clock. And heavy defensive pressure. But I was thinking of you the whole time. It’s really hot the way you carried out that dripping garbage bag full of fish sauce or whatever Vietnamese people eat. My wife is Vietnamese. I’ve no idea what the fuck she eats. Nước mắm. [chuckles] And I went into the room in the hospital you go to jerk off. It’s the medical jerking-off room. Every hospital has a medical jerking-off room. Okay? It’s nondescript, not a lot of signage. Smaller than I think it should be. Lots of crinkly tracing paper under your butt. And I’m sitting in a medical jerking-off room. By myself. And there’s grown men outside the door, waiting for me to finish… [crowd laughing] …so they, too, can use the medical jerking-off room that we are sharing like a WeWork. [crowd laughing] And I’m in a medical jerking-off room by myself. And… I couldn’t go! Okay? Sorry! Sorry for not being a pervert who can just jerk off in hospitals on demand. I’m sorry! Sorry for not being a sex offender who can just jerk off as people are dying above me and below me! Sorry! Sorry the thought of someone getting defibrillated back into life in the adjoining operating theaters, as they code to death painfully, and the families crying in the waiting room wasn’t turning me on. [crowd laughing] So I couldn’t go. I couldn’t go. So I just call 911, right? I’m like… [chuckles] [crowd laughing] I’m like, “These people are forcing me to medically ejaculate in a completely sterile room.” Uh, I call the doctor back in, and I’m like, “Doc, I can’t go.” “Okay? I can’t medically ejaculate under these circumstances.” “The vibes are off.” “Let me go home. Let me go home to medically ejaculate. Can I do that?” And the doctor’s like, “Yeah, you can go home, but, you know, as soon as it comes out of your body, it expires quicker than avocados in Hawaii, alright?” “You’ve got…” [crowd laughing] “You have, like, a 45-minute window before there’s like an exponential decreasing probability of…” [gibberish] I’m like, “Okay, fine.” “I’ll go home, I’ll medically ejaculate, I’ll come back in 45 minutes, no problem.” So I go home, open the front door, ejaculate immediately. Alright? This is… [crowd laughing] Alright? This is home court advantage. I know where everything is, I know what’s behind me. I look at the dripping garbage bag. [crowd laughing] It’s like a Pavlovian response at this point. Um… I ejaculate into a cup. Okay? It’s a cup that they gave me. It’s not a fucking coffee mug from my kitchen. [crowd laughing] That says, “World’s Best Dad” on it. [chuckles] It’s the cup that they use… doctors give you to test your pee for drugs. It’s got a really tight cap, right? So, I ejaculate into the cup. It keeps overflowing, so I gotta keep, like, pouring it out. [crowd laughing] Just overwhelming amounts. [crowd laughing] It’s like Ghostbusters 2 up in here. [crowd laughing] [chuckling] I fill it to the brim, and then I scrape off the top, and then I… And then I seal the cap as tight as I can, right? Get it really nice and tight. And then I… I put it inside my T-shirt, next to my skin, under my armpit. Nice and snug. Because the doctor told me to do that. Because apparently, like the Titanic, your body heat will keep your people alive. And then I run downstairs, and I jump into a New York City taxi, and I’m like, “Take me to Langone Hospital, please. Hurry up.” The taxi driver is like, “What the fuck are you doing with your hand?” “Are you okay?” I’m like, “Oh, yeah, no, I’m fine.” “No, it’s not me. It’s my… my wife. She’s wait… A person… It’s my jizz.” [crowd laughing] And New York City taxis have seen much worse. So, the taxi driver was like, “Oh, okay, cool.” “Thank you for using a cup.” [crowd laughing] “Unlike the last two dudes who were back there.” Just raw dogging at the JFK, you know what I’m saying?',\n",
              "  'And, uh, we get to the… we get to the hospital, right? I open the taxi door. I run into the hospital. And because it’s New York City, someone on the sidewalk is like, “Hey, yo! Hey, yo!” “Were you that guy in Shang-Chi?” [crowd laughing] “Am I… Yes, I was a minor character in the Marvel movie Shang-Chi, not the main guy.” And the guy’s like, “Yo! Yo! Can I get a photo with you?” And I’m like, “Okay, sure.” [crowd laughing] So, we take a photo like this. So, someone on the internet has a photo of me and this stranger. And I’m doing this. Like Napoleon. If you ever come across this photo, just know I am holding my own jizz. [crowd laughing] So feel free to tag it. [crowd laughing] He was very grateful. He was like, “Aw, thanks so much, man.” And I was like, “No problem, man.” I shake his hand, right? [crowd laughing] Because I love meeting my fans. And I run into the hospital, right? Already hitting the 45-minute mark. End of the fourth quarter. There’s no time left on the clock. So I just take my jizz and I just throw a buzzer-beater. Right? The doctor, like, catches my jizz, like… [crowd laughing] Like Odell Beckham. She just, like, one hand, grabs it, and, like, in the same motion, without even putting it down, she, like, alley-oops my jizz into my wife’s eggs, right? Just takes it, and she goes, “Boom, shaka-laka!” And, uh, my sperm goes into my wife’s eggs, and then nobody knows what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Nobody knows. It’s a mystery. It’s a mystery of the universe. Nobody knows. When sperm goes into the egg, it’s unknowable. Ooh, it’s… It’s like the event horizon on a black hole. No one can know what happens when sperm goes into the egg. Sometimes, nothing happens. When sperm goes into the egg, sometimes, it becomes a bubble tea. [crowd laughing] Nobody knows where bubble tea comes from. It’s “tapioca.” The sperm goes into the egg, and then you shake it, and you go to Vegas, you throw it on the crap table… And if you’re lucky, if you get a good dice roll, right? It becomes a blastocyst. That’s what we call future humans, blastocysts. It becomes embryos. The doctor, she’ll take all the embryos and she’ll look at them under the microscope, and she’ll grade the embryos. Like cocaine. [crowd laughing] She’ll be like, “Ooh, yeah, these ones? These are A-grade embryos right here.” [snorting] [crowd laughing] “These ones, these are… these are B-grade embryos, so… so I don’t know.” [crowd laughing] “These… These ones? These are C-grade embryos…” [grumbles] “Oh, and these ones?” “Yeah, these… these are… These are D-grade embryos.” “Yeah, these… These will storm the Capitol someday.” Alright? So… [crowd laughing] You don’t want that. And then… [crowd cheering] And then you have to, like, draft pick your kids based on scouting reports and analytics. And you don’t know. You’re just projecting data. You just hope you’re not throwing away a Tom Brady in the 12th round that’s going to overcome the odds and become the greatest of all time because you can’t measure the human spirit. And, uh, we all like to think we’re good people in this room, but we’re all picking the A-grade embryos, okay? No one here is not picking your A-grade embryos if given a choice. Even if you were a B-grade embryo. [crowd laughing] You would still pick your A-grade embryos. Because you’ll be like, “I know what it’s like.” “I’m not putting my kids through this B-grade human existence, with sweaty palms and sciatica.” [crowd laughing] “Give me the A-grade shit. Give me the best we could do.” “Give my kid a fighting chance.” And it got me thinking about the future a little bit because I never wanted kids. I never thought I would have kids. The only thing I ever wanted to do my whole life was this. Stand-up comedy in America. [crowd cheering] It’s the best. Look at this. It’s the best. You are cheering because you know this is way better than having kids. [crowd laughing] [crowd whooping] So much more fun and lucrative. Well, the blastocysts are real now. There’s eight of them waiting for me in the cloud. Um… 33% chance of successful implantation with grade-A embryos. So, I guess that makes me a mass murderer in Alabama. It got me thinking about the future. What kind of parent am I gonna be? Am I gonna be the same kind of parent my parents were, or am I gonna be better than my parents were? Be more emotionally supportive or whatever the fuck you’re supposed to be now, and… Thinking about it, turns out I’m gonna be just as bad as my parents were. I can… I can feel it. I can feel it inside me. I can feel the… I can feel the Chinese inside me. I can just feel that high expectation, just low tolerance for excuses. It’s in here. It’s right in here. It’s like the default app. You know, you can’t delete the calculator app. There’s no “X.” When you shake it, there’s no “X.” You can move it off the home screen, but it’s still in the OS, embedded. [crowd laughing] In the operating system, I can feel the Chinese. If my blastocyst was real, if it entered this reality, and it turned to be the cutest blastocyst ever. “Oh my God, look at this blastocyst.” “Everybody, look. Look at how beautiful this blastocyst is.” “I love you so much, blastocyst.” “I love you much more than I thought I would.” [kisses] And your blastocyst is hugging you back, right, they’re like… [in child’s',\n",
              "  'voice] “I love you too, Daddy.” “Daddy, Daddy.” “When I grow up, I want to be a stand-up comedian.” “Just like you.” [crowd laughing] I just feel the Chinese coming on, right? I just… [crowd laughing] You take your glasses off like Hitler in the bunker. [crowd laughing] “Stand-up comedy? Are you out of your fucking mind?!” [crowd laughing] “That’s not even a real job!” “What do you think is gonna happen?” “Just gonna run around America and tell jokes to strangers who don’t give a fuck about your mental health?” “And even if you do somehow manage to overcome the odds, and make it to even a semi-professional level as a stand-up comedian, do you think there’s any chance in hell you’ll be funnier than me?!” [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] “Dad is a borderline arena act in some markets!” “Have you seen my IMDb page?” “I’m in everything! I will fucking crush your career!” Osoto gari! “Your mother and I just spent a fortune to make an A-grade blastocyst for them to become a B-grade comedian.” “I will never watch anything you do.” “Go to law school!” [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Is what my father said to me. [crowd laughing] I do think it’s tough for straight men in 2024 to sincerely look up self-improvement on the internet without five weeks later storming the Capitol, okay? That men’s self-help YouTube algorithm is very unkind to straight men right now. Okay? I’m not saying it’s the biggest problem in the world. Clearly. But it is a problem, okay? Because men were genetically predisposed to seek self-improvement. Okay? We’re trying to be better people every day. Believe it or not, women. [crowd laughing] Once we hit a certain age, okay? Usually we die before then. Through suicide or environmental factors. BMX biking, dietary choices… But if you can live long enough as a man, you hit this age where suddenly you become very introspective, okay? You start seeking guidance from outside sources. You start looking at watches. Like… Like every man in this room has or will at some point. We’ve all been there. Guys, we’ve all done this. We’ve all looked in the mirror at some point in our lives. And we’ve been like, “What a fucking piece of shit.” [crowd laughing] “I fucking hate this loser.” “Look at this loser.” “Fuck this loser. I hate this person.” “I need to be a better person.” “Let me start by getting fit.” [crowd laughing] [woman screams] “Let me work on my health.” “That seems like a logical place to start my journey.” “Let me control what I can control in here.” So what do you do as a man? You go on YouTube, right? You look up how to lift weights. Right? You press “Enter.” You click on the first video. It’s some guy doing kettlebell swings, right? He’ll teach you how to lock your core so you don’t break your fucking spine. And then you do that for two days. You feel pretty good about yourself. [man] Whoo! Right? And on the third day, the same YouTube channel has a new video notification alert, The men are like, “What’s this new video from kettlebell-swinging guy?” “What could he be doing in his new video?” In the video, the kettlebell-swinging guy, he’s doing the new kettlebell exercise. “The lawnmower.” He’s doing that. And then, like 30 seconds into the video, he just, suddenly, just stops. And he looks really sad. And he puts the kettlebell down. And he looks straight into the camera. And he’s like, “Yo, guys, just real talk for a second, all right?” [sniffles] “Kettlebells are great, but I just want you guys to know that a healthy body starts with a healthy mind.” [crowd laughing] And all the men watching this are like, “Yeah.” [sniffles] “Yeah, that makes sense.” “That feels right, in here.” “Tell me more, kettlebell-swinging guy.” [crowd laughing] “What other advice do you have for all areas of my life?” “Including my relationships and financial investments.” “Please give me guidance, kettlebell-swinging guy.” So what do you do? You watch his next video on autoplay. Then you watch his next video. Here comes the YouTube algorithm with a suggested video. And here comes another suggested video. And a week later, Jordan Peterson is telling you that women use makeup to control men. [crowd laughing] Five weeks later, you’re storming the Capitol dressed like a buffalo. [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] That’s a very realistic sequence of events, by the way. That’s not even an exaggerated timeline. Every man in this room has lost a buddy to the algorithm. We all know someone who lost their fucking mind on that men’s self-help, Andrew Tate masculinity, YouTube self-help algorithm. If you don’t know anyone who lost their mind… [crowd laughing] …you’re the one who lost their mind. You’re currently in an echo chamber of assholes. ‘Cause real friends tell you when you’re losing your mind. It’s very tragic. All these men who are trying to be better people, and they’re seeking guidance. But that YouTube feedback algorithm loop just leads them to be the worst version of themselves. There’s tragedy in that. Like all those people. They were just trying to lift weights. [crowd laughing] They weren’t trying to cause an insurrection. They didn’t even know what that word meant. They were just trying to do this. They’re trying to do this. They didn’t know what angle their forearm was supposed to be vis-à-vis their torso, right? Is it 90 degrees or 45 degrees? Like, is that a different exercise or is that the same reps when you…? They Googled it one time, and then, five weeks later, you’re taking a shit on Nancy Pelosi’s desk. [crowd laughing] And the US Marshals are garnishing your',\n",
              "  'wages. Because you take one wrong turn, and life moves pretty quick! I’m not saying, as a man, don’t take responsibility for your own actions. Okay? I’m just saying that YouTube algorithm is very alluring to straight guys. It… It sucks men in in a way that I don’t think women understand. It really preys on that men’s need to seek guidance from somewhere. It’s very hard to resist. It just draws… draws you in. That’s why fucking Mark Zuckerberg is trying to MMA fight Elon Musk right now. [crowd laughing] That guy fell for his own algorithm. Do you understand? Mark Zuckerberg was just some fucking nerd. And for, like, 20 years now, he’s just been looking at our data, right? Jerking off every single day. Just looking at our data, jerking off. Money piling up. Billions of dollars. Data. Jerking off. Money, money, jerking off, data. For 20 years, that loop. And who knew after two decades of that, one day, he just looked at so much data, he was like, “Oh shit, oh shit.” He fell into it. Now he’s trying to MMA-fight Elon Musk. That guy jerked off and came on his own face. [crowd laughing] Like, it’s out of control. Zuckerberg is a billionaire who has every material need you could want in this reality. And he invented that shit, and he still fell for it. What hope does the average man in America have? Just walking… Just waddling down the street looking… looking for a taco on his phone. He’s gonna get sucked into his phone. He has no chance. That fucking guy has no chance. Because even the good guys in this room… we’re all, like, on a razor’s edge to being a piece of shit, okay? [crowd laughing] That margin between a good guy and a piece of shit is razor-thin. I gotta tell you. If you have the means, every day is just a battle to stay on that nice edge. And you know what? An Instagram post could push it either way! [crowd laughing] Okay? It depends on the post. Was it cute animals or was it boobs? [crowd laughing] That’s gonna determine your integrity for the next six hours. I do think, as a society, we need to, uh, do a better job of identifying, like, when we have a disagreement with someone who’s genuinely trying to have a good-faith discussion to reach higher understanding, and who’s just talking shit. We are spending too much time on the people who are just talking shit, and we’re not spending enough time on the people who are genuinely trying to have difficult conversations about difficult topics. Like, for example, me, right now, I’m just talking shit, okay? [crowd laughing] This is one-way shit-talking. I don’t care about any of your opinions. Do not send me any of them. I do not care. You paid for me. I didn’t pay a cent for any of you, okay? [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering] Free market capitalism has determined the direction of this shit-talking session. If you don’t like it, take it out on Adam Smith. But if I was having a conversation with someone I disagree with, in good faith, I would probably start that conversation with what we do agree with. That’d be a logical place to start a difficult conversation. For example, MAGA. Make America Great Again. They have a point. America’s not doing so great right now. Right? Our kids’ math scores are down. [crowd laughing] Our children’s science scores are down. When judged according to international metrics, uh, healthcare systems not doing so great. Wealth gap disparities increasing exponentially. There was an implied promise to a generation of Americans that if you do certain things, work hard, go to college, be a good person, you would have certain outcomes. And those outcomes didn’t materialize for the majority of people because baby boomers entrenched in decision-making positions lowered the capital gains tax… [crowd laughing] …so that their net worth essentially compounds year after year. In post-World War II, US leadership traded the domestic manufacturing industry for National Security by making the US dollar the default international trade currency, which gave America the ability to impose economic sanctions on foreign countries to a US financial banking system, but consequently increased the value of the US dollar astronomically, which made it impossible for anyone to manufacture anything in America. [inhales deeply] Although the logic at the time… [crowd laughing] …was that Americans were supposed to upskill en masse, away from the menial manufacturing jobs, but everyone here’s too much of a dumbass to stay school, so we just traded domestic manufacturing to Asia and the rest of the world at the expense of working-class families. But if you don’t read enough… [crowd laughing] …it comes out as, “Let’s go, Brandon!” [crowd laughing] And it’s like, you have a point, but you don’t have the vocabulary to describe your reality because you didn’t read enough. You gotta keep reading beyond the hashtag. There’s a book behind the word. You gotta keep going. You can go at your own pace, but you gotta finish the required reading. Otherwise, we can’t have a conversation. We’re all catching up to each other. I’m friends with MAGA. I’m friends with the MAGAs. Some of them are my good friends. [man] Whoo! Yeah. Hawaii MAGA. [crowd laughing] The friendliest of all MAGA. [crowd laughing] Aloha MAGA. They’re in Hawaii right now, Making Aloha Great Again. I became friends with them because I filmed two seasons of a TV show in Hawaii, Doogie Kameāloha, on Disney+. [crowd cheering] [applause] MAGA Hawaii welcomed me into their homes. “Ronny, please, come over. Please, we’re having a barbecue.” “We’d love you to meet the family, meet the ohana, please.” “We’d love to',\n",
              "  'have you over.” So gracious. You show up, they’re so warm and welcoming. “Thanks for coming. Take whatever you want.” “There’s some Kalua pork, there’s some loco mocos, hot dogs.” “Hey. Here. Here.” “Touch my gun.” [crowd laughing] “Touch it. Just touch… Just take it.” I’m always like, “I… I don’t want to touch any of these guns, okay?” “I don’t know where they’ve been. I don’t know where they’re going.” “I don’t have time in my schedule to attend depositions.” [crowd laughing] “Just give me the loco moco.” [crowd laughing] Very passionate people, my MAGA friends. And I respect their passion to some extent. I do. They’re like, “I love America. I would die for this country.” And I believe them. I believe they love America, and I believe they would die for this country, which is very admirable. But it’s like, man, you are willing to die for your country. Why aren’t you willing to learn math? [crowd laughing] Also for your country, like… Like, do both for your country. I know you wanna die for your country, but we’re losing the engineering jobs to Asia right now. So if you… We need less people to die for their country. We need more people to do their homework for their country. Like, do your homework for your country. Like, actually sit down and show the work, and, like, do the… That’s a more efficient way to show your patriotism. If you take that “I want to die” energy and you put it into homework, you will fucking top the school, I’m telling you. It’s… Sky’s the limit. [crowd cheering] Dude, you’ll… you’ll solve a lot of problems, you’ll create a lot of jobs, you’ll increase the GDP. Just do… do your homework for your country. “I’d rather die!” [crowd laughing] I… I thought so. I thought that might be… I thought that might be the case. Dying’s easy, math is hard. [crowd laughing] These quadratic equations making me suicidal. Uh, we try not to talk about politics, my MAGA friends and I, out of mutual respect. Inevitably, it comes up. Some stuff I’m wrong about, some stuff they’re right about, but sometimes, like, their messaging is so convoluted. Like, I can’t get to what their core issue actually is, because their surface messaging is so chaotic. Like, sometimes they’re like, “Ronny, China caused COVID, but COVID isn’t real.” [crowd laughing] So, is it fine then? Does it mean it’s fine? I don’t know how to feel about it now. ‘Cause one minus one is zero. I don’t know what to tell you. The… The math analogy works for concepts, not just numbers, you can… “X” is anything. Why are you yelling at me about China? Always yelling at me about China. “China is doing this. China did a weather balloon, with a camera.” “China’s got an artificial island in the Pacific doubling as an aircraft carrier base.” “China’s doing TikTok. Why is China doing TikTok?!” I don’t know. [crowd laughing] I’m not from China. I’m from Malaysia. [scoffs] I’m from Malaysia, not China. I’m… I’m third-generation Chinese Malaysian. Malaysia. You know Michelle Yeoh? Oscar winner? Malaysia? Yeah, that’s Malaysia. Sama-sama. Malaysia. Saya anak Malaysia. Malaysia. Malaysia, not China. Malaysia. We are the ones who lost the plane. [crowd laughing] Okay? You guys remember that? Did you see the documentary on Netflix, suggested after my special? You guys see that? That was us. [crowd laughing] That was us. We’re the “lose the plane” people. Okay? We’re not the human rights whatever… I don’t know… TikTok… I don’t know what that is, okay? We’re the… [mimics plane engine] “Ah! Where is it?! Where the fuck is it?!” That’s us. Uh, my… my MAGA friends all hate US tax. That’s like a universal party platform. There’s different types of MAGA, right? There’s, like, MAGA light, MAGA concentrated, but, like… Right, it’s unfair to group them under one banner, but one uniting party principle is, “Love America, fuck US tax.” And I get it. I also hate US tax now that I’m in the highest bracket. [crowd laughing] Yeah, I’m MAGA with that. Fuck US tax. Yeah, fuck American tax. Feels good to say it. Like the words give you power, right? Fuck US tax. Fuck American Tax. You like it? You like it when I say it? When this fucking foreigner says it? You like that? Fuck US tax. You like that? You like it when this accent says that? Fuck American tax. You like that? You don’t see a discrepancy in energy? “Love America, USA, USA.” “Fuck US tax.” Put politics aside for just three seconds. Okay? If it’s even possible. Just for three seconds, just consider this concept in a vacuum. Just as an academic exercise, okay? When you love something, you give it money. [crowd laughing] Right? Like that’s one of the primary ways we show love for individuals, organizations, ideas on Kickstarter, sports teams… We go like, “Yeah, we give it money.” So when you go, “Love America, USA, USA.” “Fuck US tax.” So what are you saying? You love America so much, you want it to be poor? You want your country to be poor? You want it to be a beggar on the street. A street beggar. You want your country to be a street beggar on the street? I love my mom. Sometimes I give my mom money. [crowd laughing] Give your mom money sometimes. [man] Yeah! Look how alien this concept is to white people. [crowd laughing] [applause] Just… silence. [crowd laughing] Give your mom money sometimes. “For what?!” [crowd laughing] Because she’s your Ma. [chuckles] And you love her, right? She loves you back, so fucking cut her off a piece every once in a while. Probably tore stuff giving birth',\n",
              "  'to you, cut her a piece of the pie. Arbitrarily, even. Just give a… I’m sure your mother would appreciate it. No matter who your mom is, how self-accomplished she is, I’m sure your mom could use it. Fix the driveway, invest in infrastructure. Something. [crowd laughing] Sometimes Americans treat their country the way they treat their parents. [indistinct chatter from crowd] Yeah. [crowd laughing] “I love my mom. I love my mom. I would die for my mom.” “But fuck her, she made her choices.” [crowd laughing] I love being in America. I do. I love being here. I had my options. I came here. I love being in America because this is the country that puts show business above everything. And I am in the business of show business. So naturally, I’m gonna come here and do it. I do this in America, “Fuck America. Fuck the president. Fuck US tax,” money, money just comes into… [crowd laughing] “Fuck the president.” “He’s too old. Fuck this president.” The money comes in. Money just comes in. Like printing money. I do this in Malaysia, same… same words, same… same clothing, same haircut, facing the same direction, in Malaysia? Jail. [crowd laughing] Like, the arbitrage value is out of control. Same product in different loc… Obviously, I’ll do this here. Why the fuck would I do it anywhere else? It’s the best. I think, uh, sometimes people forget I’m a first-generation immigrant here. Because my second-generation or later American friends, like, their parents were immigrants. And the way they talk about their parents is so disrespectful. And they forget, like, I’m also an immigrant. They’ll be like, “You know my parents? They’re immigrants.” “You know immigrants. They’re so cheap.” [crowd laughing] Like, “Don’t come over. My family’s over this weekend. My parents are here.” “My parents are immigrants. You know immigrants. Ugh!” “They’re so cheap.” Yo, I want to defend immigrants here for a second, all right? Fuck that shit. Yeah, my mom lives in Singapore. She is not an immigrant. She is still extremely cheap. [crowd laughing] Okay? Being cheap is not an immigrant thing. It’s genetic. [crowd laughing] Cheap people are cheap. They’re not choosing to be cheap. It’s just inside, it’s not a choice. Chinese baby boomers are cheap ’cause they don’t know how to have fun. They haven’t had fun in, like, 50 years. They, like, forgot the energy of fun. Like, of all the Asians right now in the Asian fun hierarchy, from most fun to least fun, Chinese baby boomers, least fun of all the Asians right now. I can say this. I’m Chinese, okay? You don’t fucking say it. [crowd laughing] This is our “N” word. You don’t fucking say it. I say it. You don’t fucking say it. Least fun… You don’t fucking say it. Least fun of all the Asians, Chinese baby boomers. Right now, of all the Asians, most fun Asians, uh, the Koreans, okay? You gotta give it up for the Koreans. [crowd cheering] [crowd laughing] Give it up for the Koreans. You gotta tip your cap and respect the back-to-back championships of the modern-day Koreans just killing it with the fun and the pop culture. They’re… Everyone’s… They’ve got Blackpink. They got music. They got BTS. [crowd cheering] Dude, BTS is right now in the army fighting Kim Jong-un. [crowd laughing] Do you understand? BTS is at the DMZ right now, just going… [singsongs pop beat playfully] [mimics machine gun] [crowd laughing] Just an unstoppable force of entertainment. [chuckling] Taking down countries and dictatorships. They got, uh… Koreans got, uh, the Parasite movie, Oscar-winning. They got Past Lives. They got, uh… Crash Landing on You. [crowd cheering] Just dominating the Netflix home page of white people. [crowd laughing] Never thought I’d see the day when white people’s homepage is full of K-drama. Just binging. Non-stop. They got, uh, Squid Game. Dude, Koreans have more fun dying in Squid Game than Chinese people have at comedy shows. Chinese people at comedy shows, they’re looking at their phone. “Do I have to look up?” “He’s here? Okay, I’m gonna video for six minutes.” Full flash video. This is… This is how I live in the moment as a Chinese person. Koreans, most fun. Uh, Filipinos know how to have fun. [crowd cheering] Yeah, they love having fun, uh… Vietnamese people know how to have fun. Cambodians know how to have fun. Hmong people know how to have fun. Even Japanese know how to have fun. In a reserved way. [crowd cheering] Outwardly stoic. Inside, just anime. [crowd laughing] Outside, unreadable. Inside, just the intro to Sailor Moon. Right? Just… [crowd laughing] [humming the intro to Sailor Moon] Outside is just, “Ohayo gozaimasu.” [crowd laughing] Japanese people have so much fun sometimes they go straight back to work. [crowd laughing] “You’re not gonna change your suit? Just straight into the office? Alright.” [chuckles] Uh… Everyone knows Chinese baby boomers, least fun of all the Asians. Because for Chinese baby boomers, their primary directive in life is, “Do not get scammed.” That’s like the overriding directive that informs the entire decision-making tree. RoboCop, primary directive, “Do not get scammed.” “Do not arrest OCP executive.” “Do not get scammed.” And for Chinese baby boomers, there’s no value proposition, okay? It’s just pure price sensitivity. That means any money outgoing is a scam. [crowd laughing] “If money leaves my possession, that was a scam!” [crowd laughing] So the whole time, they’re just tensed up, they’re just looking for scams when they go out. They’re just like… They can’t even relax. “Scam’s coming!” It’ll be a two-drink minimum over here. Parking guys, tip… [grumbling] Tensing up. Meanwhile, Koreans in the back just having fun. [crowd laughing] Filipinos dancing like… Chinese baby boomers just tensed',\n",
              "  \"up. The further they get from their house, as distance X increases, they know the fees will increase and so the ex… The expenditures are gonna increase, so they keep tensing up. The further they get, until eventually, like, their whole body tenses up into, like, a “C,” right? Like a “C” for Chinese. [crowd laughing] And then, in the back you’re like, “Go, go, have fun! Have fun!” They just refuse to have fun. Like, my mom came and visited me in New York City. Her only son, she came to New York City. New York City is the kind of city where, as soon as you open your front door, it’s like $1.50. Like, if you touch your door knob, it’s like, Apple Pay $1.50, just going… It goes into the universe. My mom came in and approached the front door in New York. She’s like in the back of the apartment, “I’m good, I don’t need to leave the house today.” My mom isn’t even scared of Asian hate. She’s more scared of inflation. [crowd laughing] She can’t believe the prices of things anymore. You take her out to Central Park. “Let’s go to Central Park, it’s free.” “Look how beautiful New York is in autumn. Look at this.” “Why are these hot dogs five dollars? It’s like, “No, this…” “The price is right. No one is scamming you.” “That’s the correct amount of money to pay for that.” “You haven’t been out of the house in 50 years. That number is correct.” “That’s how much things cost after baby boomers destroyed the global financial economy in 2010 pursuing subprime mortgages, okay?” That’s… That’s… If anything, you scammed yourself. That’s you scamming yourself. Yeah, “You played yourself.” DJ Khaled. [crowd laughing] My mom came to visit me in Hawaii. Her first time in Hawaii. And if you know Hawaii, locals and the Hawaiians here, the least scammy culture on the planet. Could not be more generous as a community. You get so much more than you give when you’re on the islands of Hawaii. And, uh, my mom comes, and she lands, and she gets to the hotel, and they welcome her, “Aloha. Welcome to Hawaii.” And they put a lei over her, like a ring of flowers. They put it over her, and my mom does this. [crowd laughing] “I’m not paying for that.” [crowd laughing] And I’m like, “You can’t do that, Mom.” “They’re not trying to trick you into buying something.” “They’re trying to welcome you to their homeland.” “They’re not tricking you into buying just ’cause you touched it.” “This isn’t Thailand. Just put on…” [crowd laughing] “Put on the lei, you’re embarrassing me in front of the Hawaiians!” Mahalo. [crowd laughing] [applause] [crowd cheering] These Chinese baby boomers, most scared of being scammed in real life, the first to get scammed on the internet. For people who live in fear their entire lives, extremely gullible. Because these baby boomers, they don’t have the… they don’t have the antibodies to deal with the internet. Completely clueless when they go on now. Like, watching baby boomers go on the internet now is like watching babies wandering into the kitchen by themselves, just looking for cookies on the kitchen countertop, just like… Running their hands blindly on the kitchen countertop. Pulling down knives. Kitchen knives coming straight down into their eyeballs, into, like, the soft part of their skull. They go in the kitchen, they open the oven, they turn it on. They stick their head inside. They’re like, “Any pictures of my grandkids in here?” “Is this link safe to click on? Is this link safe to click on?” “Is this link safe to click on?” Just falling for every basic bitch internet scam possible. These fucking baby boomers tumbling into internet scams like pandas rolling down a hill. [crowd laughing] Just jujitsu-rolling into scams every single day. Loving scams. “Oh, what do you want? 20 Target gift cards?” “Yeah, sounds like a legitimate way to pay for antivirus software on my phone.” “Everybody, look. Look at this link. Look, there’s a…” “‘What’s the one trick your doctor doesn’t want you to know?'” “Okay, I’ll click on that link.” “I knew it. I knew my doctor was scamming me!” “That was a trick he didn’t want me to know.” “I’m gonna invalidate his medical degree with one click right now!” [grunts] “This is not the scam. My doctor is the scam. Let me…” [grunts] Click on this… These fucking internet idiot savants who can’t remember a single goddamn password, but for some reason, can make any piece of misinformation go viral. Like a Russian cyber army, just spreading misinformation around the world in family group WhatsApp chats. Everywhere. “Everybody, just look at this article. Is this real?” “Look at it. Is this real?” It’s how they fact-check! They spread it. “Look at this, this is a real…? Everybody, weigh in.” “I’m not saying a hair dryer in your mouth will kill COVID.” “Okay? But what? You can’t ask questions anymore?” “Look at this article from cnn-n-n-n.ru.” “Quick, send it to your uncle, send it to your…” “Send it to our whole family tree. Everybody needs to see this.” Has there ever been a dumber generation of idiots more susceptible to fake news than these fucking baby boomers literally believing everything they see on the internet? I get the very reasonable argument that every generation of human is going to be naturally a little bit smarter than the last, due to the exponential technology growth curve, okay? But this has got to be the biggest gap in human history! The information asymmetry right now is just out of control. You literally have people in Honolulu right now auto-driving their Tesla Cybertrucks as they vape\",\n",
              "  'out the window, and their phone AI is trading cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, you have baby boomers, they can’t even right-click. [crowd laughing] They can’t even right-click. “There’s one button! How do you right-click on one button?!” It’s scary. They don’t know what’s real anymore. “Hey, Ronny. Look at this photo of Bigfoot shopping at Whole Foods.” [crowd laughing] “Bigfoot is real now!” “Look, there’s an image of him buying kombucha at Whole Foods.” “What technology exists that can fake images?” I’m like, “Mom, that’s not real. Stop sending it around. It’s not real.” “How do you know?” They always get so indignant about it. Like, “How do you know that it’s not real?” “How did you know that?” Because the font, the font is off and the resolution of the image is blurry, and that lighting state doesn’t make sense for that image! And that’s not standard dimensions for a news article. I can’t give you this knowledge. It’s like Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink! I’ve seen so much shit on the internet, my brain instantly filters it. You’ll never have this skill set, so just stay off the internet! This world is not for you anymore! Stop making decisions! [crowd cheering and clapping] But anyway, respect your elders. [crowd laughing] It’s a Confucian value. Maybe if you give your mom some money, she wouldn’t get scammed so much. Yeah, well… Think about the correlation between those two phenomena. Uh… People always ask me, like, “Why do you shit on your mom for money?” “Why don’t you shit on your dad for money?” Alright, uh… [chuckles] No, I don’t talk about my dad because, uh, my dad has no context for show business. Like, we grew up in Malaysia. Like, his families are rubber tappers in Malaysia. My aunts and uncles are still in Sitiawan in Malaysia right now tapping rubber. They have no context for show business. Very smart people, but they don’t know this world. My dad, he was the first guy in his family to get a college education. He went to Manchester College, which has merged with the University of Southern New Hampshire. He got his master’s of economics there. Put himself through it. Very smart guy. And he was a good immigrant. He came to America, to New Hampshire, to get his education, and when he graduated, he went back to Malaysia. He didn’t take anyone’s job, he left. [crowd laughing] And my dad had the vision to see what I didn’t see. He knew he had a ceiling on him, because of the way he thinks and talks, and he went back to Malaysia. And he was right! For him. He went back. It was the right choice for him. He became a very successful corporate executive. Uh, he retired to a farm in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Love farming. He retired to a farm. That’s how much this guy loved it, but he had no context for show business, so he wouldn’t understand anything I’m doing. Like, he wouldn’t understand what I’m doing in Godzilla vs. Kong. He’d be like, “Why don’t you just run that way?” [crowd laughing] “Dad, I don’t control the edit. Okay?” “I’m just Honolulu Chinatown shopkeeper No. 3 in this…” “In this epic clash of titans between the giant lizard and the giant gorilla, okay?” “I’m just connecting Act 1 to Act 2, I don’t have a say in how this plays out.” Because of that, I stopped telling him about what I was doing. I felt he wouldn’t get it, and he stopped asking me. So I didn’t tell him I got hired on The Daily Show. He found out the way all parents find out about their kids’ accolades, through a local newspaper. So, one day, the local paper reported that I got hired on The Daily Show, and he called me immediately. He was like, Ronny, what’s this I hear about you joining “The Everyday Show”? And I was like, “Oh no, it’s The Daily Show.” “I joined like two years ago, Dad.” He was like, “Oh, okay. Well, what’s The Daily Show?” I’m like, “It’s just like another late-night American talk show.” “They kind of invented modern American satire.” And… [clicks tongue] And, uh, my dad was like, “Oh, that’s cool. Are you the host?” I’m like, “No, I’m a correspondent.” He was like, “What is that? What’s a correspondent?” I’m like, “Yeah, correspondent is, I help the host with comedy segments.” And he was like, “Oh, okay.” “Hey, Mei! He’s just a sidekick.” [crowd laughing] And so he had, like, no context for what was a win, what was a milestone in this industry. And so, I stopped telling him, and he stopped asking me. And I didn’t need that from him. We… We were totally fine. We’d talk about other stuff. Not about work. We weren’t fighting. It was all good. Uh, and he passed away very suddenly, uh, in 2018. He died on Christmas Eve. Died on his farm, like, no warning, no explanation. He just left one day. He left so suddenly, we had to go back to handle his estate. If anyone here has been so unfortunate to be in that position, when you have to handle someone else’s estate, it means that they left so abruptly that other people had to come in and close the administrative loops in their life. And so it’s me, my wife, my sister, brother-in-law, went back to Johor Bahru, and part of me trying to figure out his estate was I had to hack into his laptop just to figure out what banks he was using. So, his laptop was right on the kitchen table where he left it, and I opened it up, and it’s password-protected, and I know this guy so well, I’m',\n",
              "  'like, “His password is going to be the birthday of his favorite child.” So… [crowd laughing] …I type in my sister’s birthday, and spot on. Spot on. It was my sister’s birthday. [crowd laughing] As it should be. She’s, like, an anesthesiologist in Australia. She’s like way more respectable person than me, actually saving lives like a good person. Contributing back to society, not like this fucking asshole. I get in… [chuckles] I get in trouble on the internet for shit I said two years ago, every six weeks. So it should be her. She should be the favorite. So, I log into his computer, I open his web browser, I look at his browsing history, and the whole time, I’m like, “Please don’t let me find my dad’s porn.” “Please don’t let me find what positions my dad was into.” “Even if it was just missionary, I wouldn’t be able to handle it.” “I’m gonna have to burn this laptop.” For real Chinese people, when we burn things, it goes to our ancestors, and then my granddad is gonna see it, and it’s like, I don’t… I don’t want that for them. I’ll be fine, but they’re gonna have an awkward time. I’m considerate like that, uh… So I open the web browser, look at his history, and way to go, Dad, no porn. What a clean-cut guy. No porn. He only went on the internet twice a day. Like clockwork. 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Like the farmer that he was. And every time he went on the internet, he’d only go to two websites each time. So, the first website he’d go to was a local news website, and the second website he’d go to twice a day, every single day, was my Twitter page. [crowd] Aw… So, he’d be reloading my Twitter page twice a day just to see what I was doing. And I post stuff like, “Hey, Honolulu, Hawaii, I sold out five shows, uh, this week, why’s there so many homeless people here?” I’d post stuff like that. [crowd laughing] And, uh… he would read that, and then he’d be like… I assume, he’d be like, “Oh, Ronny’s doing okay.” “He’s in Hawaii, he sold out some shows, and oh, I guess there’s a lot of homeless people in Hawaii.” Uh, and, um, that was his quiet way of keeping up with me. He never told me that, and I never knew that, and we never discussed it, um, which is a very nice sentiment. Unfortunately, uh, as best as I can tell, this is the last tweet my dad read of mine. [crowd laughing] So, as best as I can tell, forensically, based on internet browsing timestamps, the last tweet my dad read of mine, and quite possibly, the last thing he ever read before he died on his farm, was me posting on Twitter, “If you’re a baby boomer on Twitter, I already know you’re a fucking loser.” [crowd laughing] Now, obviously, this was not directed towards him. I didn’t even know he had Twitter. I didn’t even know he knew what Twitter was. But I stand by the statement. [crowd laughing] [applause] And I know that’s kind of a weird way to end the show, but, um… [crowd laughing] [chuckles] …if it’s any solace, uh, this was his phone when he died. [crowd] Aw! That was his, uh, wallpaper and his screensaver. And… [chuckles] And I didn’t even know. And it’s a photo of me and my wife, and we’re in Hawaii. And I’m wearing two leis ’cause my mom threw one off and I put it on. [crowd laughing] And, uh, I didn’t know that this was his screensaver and his wallpaper. Uh, and… [applause] Uh… I… I like to… I like to think that, uh, that is the last image he saw of me. That’s what he remembered me by when he left. And, uh, I also would like to tell my sister, I won! [crowd laughing] I won! It was me! It was me! You guys have been great. Thanks for coming out, Honolulu.

Follow her journey as she shares an intimate look of her life in a hilarious way. [upbeat music] [sentimental music] [announcer] Please welcome Taylor Tomlinson! [audience cheering] Thank you so much! [cheering] Thank you! Thank you, guys, so much! Thank you! I so, so appreciate you guys being here. It’s been a rough couple of years. I got bangs at one point. Shit got dark. [audience laughs] I didn’t even want bangs. I just needed people to check on me. And it works, by the way. You post a selfie in bangs, everybody’s like, “Fire emoji. You go, girl!” Then they text you, like, “You okay?” [audience laughs] Here’s what I did. I got bangs and then two days later, I did mushrooms for the first time. [audience laughs] And as soon as I did those mushrooms, I was like, “I should’ve done these first. [audience laughs] Probably wouldn’t have gotten these bangs if I forgave myself, huh?” [audience laughs] But you know what? Having bangs feels exactly like being on mushrooms. The whole time, you’re just looking at your friends, like, “Do I look weird? [audience laughs] You guys would tell me if I looked weird, right? Is it… Is it bad different? Is it not good… You know what? I changed my mind. I don’t want to do it. It’s too late? It’s already happening? Okay, no, I can be this person.” I got back into therapy. Anybody in therapy? [audience cheers] Mostly women. That’s the problem. [audience laughs] It’s very hard to stay in therapy. My old therapist told me that when I get close to people, I have a tendency to self-sabotage. And I thought that was bullshit, so I ghosted her. [audience laughs] And then… I finally went back because I finally dated enough people who all gave me the exact same feedback about my shitty personality. You know, that romantic quota you hit where you’re, like, [laughing] “Uh-oh! Might be me! [audience laughs] Oh, the reviews are in and they are [blows raspberry] unanimous. That’s a bummer.” So after a really bad breakup a few years ago, I finally took a long hard look at myself and said, “Okay, Taylor, five out of five dudes all think that in fights, you behave like a raccoon trapped in a trash bag.” [audience laughs] “So maybe it’s time to get some Klonopin or a rabies shot.” [audience laughs] I am fully medicated now. Anybody else? Anti-depressants? [audience cheers] Medication? Yeah. Nice. What are we on? Shout it out. [audience shouting indistinctly] Zoloft, Lexapro. Oh! Look at us. Gang’s all here! [audience laughs] Oh my God! I’m also on something. I would never say what, that’s very personal, but… [audience laughs] No, I’m kidding. I’m on a few things. I am on Klonopin as needed for panic attacks. I’m so glad I have Klonopin now because before I had medication for it, I would have panic attacks right when I had to be somewhere, which is the worst time to get them ’cause then you just have to pinch the panic attack off like a shit you don’t have time to take. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? When you’re, like, “Okay, I got 60% of that out of my system. [audience laughs] I’m not done but I gotta go to work. [audience laughs] I will get to the other 40 later or I’ll finish in the big stall at lunch if no one’s in there. [audience laughs] I got put on something else for sleep because I have night terrors. There’s no fun, casual way to say that. [giggles] “Wake up screaming and…” [audience laughs] These sleeper time pills I got are great. They don’t stop the nightmares but they do hold you down while they’re happening. [audience laughs] Which sounds bad but before, I’d wake up in the middle so afraid and now, I stay asleep until the nightmare’s natural conclusion, [audience laughs] which provides you with some closure. [audience laughs] You’re like, “Oh, he stabs me at the end. [audience gasps] Okay, plot twist, M. Nightmare Shyamalan.” [audience laughs] I thought I was on an anti-depressant. It turns out I’m not. It turns out I’m actually on a mood stabilizer that they use as an anti-depressant. Fun fact about prescription drugs. Everything they prescribe, they actually use for, like, four different things. So you don’t really know what your deal is until you find a combo that works and then Google all your pills by yourself. [audience laughs] So after years of trial and error, I finally found a combination of things that worked for me, and six months ago, I decided to Google it ’cause what the hell. And it turns out that everything I’m taking is primarily used for bipolar disorder. So I went back to my psychiatrist and I was, like, “Hey. [audience laughs] Do we think…?” [audience laughs] And she was, like, “Oh! Yeah!” [audience laughs] And I was, like, “Is this how you fucking tell people?” [audience laughs] And she’s, like, “No, of course not. We didn’t know. I’m glad we figured it out.” And I was, like, “We?” [audience laughs] I said, “You really didn’t know that I was bipolar?” And she goes, “No, of course not. We thought we were treating anxiety and depression.” And I said, “Okay. ‘Cause this kinda feels like a putting your dog’s medication in cheese situation.” [audience laughs] And I was, like, “I don’t know how I feel about this diagnosis.” And she goes, “Well, if it makes you feel better, you don’t have to say, ‘I am bipolar.’ You can say, ‘I have bipolar.'” [audience chuckles] Which feels a lot like someone going, “I said you were being a bitch.” [audience laughs] I’m so glad I know that\",\n",
              "  'I’m bipolar now. I mean, I have the right meds, I got a mood ring, I’m handling it. [audience laughs] But when I first found out, it was a very tough pill to swallow. And I’ve swallowed a lot of pills. [audience laughs] Because when you first find out something like that, you’re, like, “Oh man, am I gonna tell anybody? Should I tell anybody? And if I do tell people, am I hot and/or talented enough to be an inspiration?” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] Like, if I have a thing and someone else has that thing and they find out I have it too, are they gonna feel good or bad with that information? Because when I got diagnosed, they started listing names. They were, like, “You know who else is bipolar? Selena Gomez.” And I was, like, “That does make me feel better. [audience laughs] She is very pretty. [audience laughs] Okay, I’ll be bipolar.” [audience laughs] I did not grow up in a household that was very, like, mental health-conscious. Like, we were very religious. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to tell your conservative dad that you have a mental health issue. It doesn’t go great. When I was in high school, I was like, “Dad, I think I’m depressed.” And he was, like, “You just need some protein. Get a scoop of peanut butter.” [audience laughs] Yeah, there’s a lot of dads out there just white-knuckling it through life right now, clinging to a jar of chunky Jif like it’s the answer, just a buoy in the storm. “It’ll pass!” [audience laughs] The only mental health advice my dad ever gave me is I was having panic attacks in high school and I didn’t know what they were and I was very stressed out. And I was, like, “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do when I feel like this. I don’t know what to do.” And he goes, “Alright. All I can tell you is that when you feel like this, get as far away from the people you care about as possible… [audience laughs] …until you feel different.” Which is advice you give a werewolf, like… [audience laughs] “Just run into the woods ’til you’re not a monster anymore. Don’t let them see you change. They won’t accept you for what you truly are.” [audience laughs] And I had friends who scared me too when I was trying to get on medication. They were, like, “Ugh, I tried. I tried anti-depressants. I didn’t like how I felt on them. I didn’t feel like myself.” And now that I’m on them, I’m, like, “Yeah, me neither! It’s the best.” [audience laughs] Okay? And I do feel like myself. I just feel like now someone’s sitting on me going, “Shh! [audience laughs] Stop talking. You will ruin everything. We are… We are trying to help you. You’d be married right now if you just shut the hell up. [audience laughs] Remember that? Yeah, us too. We are trying to help you. Go to sleep. Choose a different adventure.” [audience laughs] And they warn you about the side effects when you get on medication. They go, “You know, your sex drive might go down.” And I’ll be honest, I have experienced that since I got on medication, but I can’t tell if my sex drive is lower or if my self-esteem is just higher now. [audience laughs] You know? [audience claps, cheers] It’s, like, am I not in the mood, or do I just not need the validation? Which is it? Because depression will bring you to your knees and you’re, like, “While I’m down here, might as well make someone feel good. I… do not want to waste a trip.” [audience whoops] If you’re not laughing, congrats on your serotonin. [audience laughs] And if you’re, like, “What’s serotonin?” Don’t worry. You have enough. [audience laughs] I wasn’t sure if I was gonna talk about it on stage, and then I needed new material and I was, like, “Fire sale! Everything goes.” [audience laughs] No, truthfully, I was surprised that I felt so bad about it ’cause I think I’m pretty open-minded. And I don’t think anybody should feel bad if they get diagnosed with a mental illness ’cause it’s just information about you that helps you know how to take better care of yourself. [audience cheers] Yeah. Being bipolar, there’s nothing wrong with it. Being bipolar is like not knowing how to swim. It might be embarrassing to tell people and it might be hard to take you certain places. [audience laughs] [audience continues laughing] But they have arm floaties. [audience laughs] And if you just take your arm floaties, you can go wherever the hell you want. [audience laughs] And… I know some of you are, like, “But Taylor, what if people judge me for taking arm floaties?” Well, those people don’t care if you live or die, so maybe who cares? [audience whoops] Maybe fuck those people a little. [audience cheers] I don’t know. That being said, you have to take your arm floaties [audience laughs] because it’s not cool to know you can’t swim, go to the public pool anyway, and jump into the deep end, making it everyone else’s problem. [audience laughs] And you thrash around going, “I’m good!” They’re like, “You’re literally drowning.” And then someone nice and handsome jumps in to help you. And you’re, like, “See? I’m fine. I can totally swim.” And they’re, like, “No, you’re holding him underwater. [audience laughs] You turned Kevin into an arm floaty [audience laughs] and that’s not a fair relationship for Kevin.” [audience laughs] Then someone floats by you on their back and you’re, like, “What was that?” And they’re, like, “Oh, that’s someone whose parents supported them in the pool… [audience laughs] …until they could be trusted not to die. [audience laughs] Here are your arm floaties.” [audience laughs] I was very nervous to tell friends of mine I was bipolar because I thought they would think of me differently. And then I told all my friends and nobody did and it was actually pretty insulting. [audience laughs] Because I’ve had friends tell me they were bipolar and I was, like, “What? You? You’re kidding.” And then I told my friends',\n",
              "  \"and they were, like, “That checks out. That’s… [audience laughs] That connects a lot of dots for us.” I told Dustin, one of my best friends in the whole world, and he goes, “Yeah, your mental illness was kinda like your middle name. I didn’t know what it was but I knew that you had one.” [audience laughs] It’s really good. That was not the feedback I kept getting from romantic partners, by the way. [audience laughs] That’s not what finally made me get help. Every guy I’ve ever dated has told me I have trust issues, which is something liars say when you’re on to them. [audience laughs] [in deep voice] “You have trust issues, babe.” You have a hot co-worker and a locked phone, so… [audience laughs] I have trust issues but I earned them, okay? [audience laughs] I absolutely earned them, like, I got cheated on in college. My college boyfriend was sleeping with sex workers behind my back, or prostitutes if you’re old and don’t know that word’s not okay to use anymore. Sometimes older crowd members could get confused ’cause they’re, like, “What is a sex worker?” “Is that what my granddaughter does on Instagram?” [audience laughs] And you’re, like, “No, no, no, she’s just hot. That’s a FabFitFun box.” “That’s a different…” [audience laughs] “That’s a different thing.” [audience laughs] “Your granddaughter doesn’t… That’s not a job.” “That’s not real.” [audience laughs] You can’t say prostitute anymore. Calling a sex worker a prostitute is like calling a comedian a clown. You’re not technically wrong but you are a fucking asshole, so… [audience laughs] But I told my therapist I got cheated on like this and she didn’t say what I wanted her to say, which was, “Poor baby, sweetie, this session is free.” [audience laughs] Instead, she goes, “Well, you might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.” And I was like, “Oh!” And she’s like, “No, it’s a bad thing.” And I was like, [audience laughs] “Well, then could you say I have self-fulfilling prophecy? [audience laughs] Is Selena Gomez a self-fulfilling prophecy?” [audience laughs] And I said, “What does that mean, I’m a self-fulfilling prophecy?” And she goes, “Well, sometimes we expect someone to treat us poorly, so we treat them like they’re going to treat us poorly until they do.” “You thought someone was gonna cheat on you, so you treated them like they were gonna cheat on you until they did cheat on you, and then you were like, ‘See?'” [audience chuckles] And I was like, “Oh.” [audience laughs] “So I’m a witch.” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] And she’s like, “Oh! So close. You’re a bitch.” “You gotta…” [audience laughs] I’m like, “Whatever. All I heard was Gryffindor!” [audience laughs] I am working on my trust issues. I was so much worse when I first started seeing my therapist. I told her like first session, I was like, “The guy I’m dating keeps answering my phone calls, ‘Hey, beautiful?'” [audience laughs] And she’s like, “So, what’s the problem?” I was like, “I mean, I don’t know yet.” [audience laughs] “But when I find out who ‘Beautiful’ is…” [audience laughs] She’s like, “Do you think it might be you?” I was like, “I’m sorry. I thought we were here to work.” [audience laughs] I think I’m cute or whatever now, but I was an ugly kid with honest parents, and that shit stays in your bones, alright? If you were an ugly kid with honest parents, I don’t care how attractive you grow up to be, at any point, if someone’s like, “You look really nice today,” you’re like, “Yeah, whatever. I know the Goddamn truth.” [audience laughs] When I was ten, I said, “Dad, am I pretty?” And his response was, “Look.” [audience laughs] “I’m not the best looking guy, right?” “No, but I wake up every morning and I try.” [audience laughs] “I…” “I take a shower, I put on a nice suit, and I do okay!” [audience whoops] And then he went to work. [audience laughs] And I became a comedian, I guess. [audience laughs] That was his response to his ten-year-old daughter. Just like, “You and me, potato face, these were the cards we were dealt.” “Get clean and match.” “That’s all you can do. Don’t sleep on wet hair. Can’t do that.” “Maybe wear a hat sometimes. Cover up some of that head.” “I’m sorry there’s so much of it.” [audience laughs] I think I’m pretty. I have a big head. I know I do ’cause every guy I’ve ever dated has made a point to be like, “I love your big head.” [audience laughs] That’s my favorite thing guys do when they compliment the thing you hate most about yourself, they’re like, “I love your soft arms.” You’re like, “Okay. [audience laughs] Yeah? I love your weird balls. How does it feel? [audience laughs] [audience cheers] How does it feel to be accepted?” [audience chuckles] I’m a nightmare to date. [audience laughs] Anything nice you do or say, I’m just like, “Whatever.” I dated a guy once who told me that flirting with me was like punching water. [audience laughs] And I was like, “Why? ‘Cause it’s pointless or ’cause you look stupid doing it?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Did you hear it?” I’m like, “I heard it that time. Yeah.” [audience laughs] And then he cheated on me, so, you know, prophecy fulfilled! [audience laughs] I can’t help it. At the beginning of a relationship with a guy, I just assume anything nice he does is he a move he pulls on everybody and I’m not gonna fall for your choreography, sir. [audience laughs] I’m like, “Oh, is this… is this your move? You open the car door for me on the date? [woman laughs] Is this like your move? [chuckles] This is how you do it? That’s cute. Bet that works a lot.” [audience laughs] “Oh, is this… is this your move? You go with me to my grandpa’s funeral, hold an umbrella over my head in the rain? [audience laughs] Is this like… Is this like your move? This is how you do it? [audience laughs] Like, ‘Whoops, don’t get wet.’ ‘Oops! I am.’ Whatever. [audience laughs, cheers] This ain’t my first rodeo. I used to have two grandpas.” [audience laughs] [audience\",\n",
              "  'chuckles] “Oh, is this… Is this your move? [audience chuckles] You die next to me in a hospital bed at 86 years old holding my hand for all eternity? Is this like your move? This is how you get pussy?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “We’ve been together for 60 years.” I’m like, “You’re a fuckboy and I know it! [audience laughs] Don’t bury me with this guy. He’s been dying with other people behind my back. [audience laughs] I can’t prove it. Check his phone when he uses the bedpan.” [audience laughs] And that’s why we’re in therapy. [audience laughs] People are scared to go to therapy because they think it’s someone sitting in a chair going, “You suck.” But it’s not. It’s you in a chair going, “I suck.” [audience laughs] And then your therapist is like, “That’s great. Let’s start there.” [audience laughs] Therapy just helps you to get to the bottom of why you’re trash, okay? You go into therapy and you’re like, “Here’s all the stuff that sucks about me.” And she goes, “Okay.” And she puts it all up on the wall like you’re solving a crime together. Fun! [audience laughs] And then she gets some of that red string that detectives use at home when they’ve been thrown off the case for going rogue [audience laughs] and she starts connecting each crappy thing about you to each one of your corresponding childhood traumas, and you’re like, “Oh my God! That’s why I’m like this.” And she’s like, “That’s why you’re like this.” And you’re like, “Am I fixed now?” And she’s like, “God, no! [audience laughs] No, no, no.” You’re like, “Well, what do I do now?” She’s like, “Well, you keep coming back in here every week with your credit card.” And you’re like, “What? Will I ever be fixed?” She’s like, “I don’t know. Bring your credit card!” [audience laughs] I’ve got to the bottom of a lot of stuff in therapy. I’m an emotional eater. I don’t know if anybody else identifies with that. [audience whoops] Cool. Seven people. Everyone else is like, “No, we just eat until we’re almost full and then we thank God for the opportunity, okay.” [audience laughs] “Food is just fuel for me.” If you’re one of those, fuck right off, for real. [audience laughs] I’ll refund your money. I don’t need your support. [audience cheers] I’m doing fine. If you don’t know what an emotional eater is, it just means you like eat to cope with uncomfortable feelings. So if I’m like sad or anxious or awake, I like to be eating to take the edge off. [audience laughs] If you still don’t know if that’s you, you can ask yourself a few questions to find out. Number one. When you eat nachos in public, do you get kinda mad that other people are there to see it? [audience laughs] Do you feel like nachos should come with a privacy curtain? I do. [audience laughs] Have all the best meals of your life taken place in your own car around 11 p.m.? [audience laughs] Under a flickering streetlamp? Have you ever eaten a brownie while you felt okay [audience laughs] and wished you were sad… [audience laughs] …so that it tasted better? [audience laughs] Sounds like more than seven of us. [audience laughs] In therapy, I figured out the day in my childhood I became an emotional eater. I was eight years old and I was eating a bagel in the kitchen and my dad came in and he goes, “You’re gonna want to put that bagel down. I gotta tell you something.” And that’s when he told me that my mom had died. So somewhere in my brain, something clicked, like, “Oh, when you stop eating bread, [audience laughs] people perish.” [audience laughs] I went back to fourth grade like the angel of death. Everyone’s like, “Step on a crack, break your mother’s back.” I’m like, “Stop eating bread, now your mom’s dead, dude. [audience laughs] They left out that second part but…” I had a lisp when I was eight. I tell you guys that because no one told me. [audience laughs] They pulled me aside a year later at school. Someone’s like, “Taylor, your teacher thinks you might be struggling with a speech impediment.” I’m like, [with lisp] “What’s a speech impediment? [audience laughs] [with lisp] Are you sure you have the right person, ’cause… I’m crushing it out there.” [audience laughs] And they’re like, “You didn’t do anything wrong. You just pronounce your words a little differently, like you say “sh” instead of “ss” for your S’s, does that make sense? And I was like, [with lisp] “I’m pretty sure I would have noticed [audience laughs] if I said ‘sh’ instead of ‘sh’. Hope you find who you’re looking for. [audience laughs] If you have any follow-up questions, I’ll be on the see-saw.” [audience laughs] I know dead mom jokes make people uncomfortable. I know that and if you are uncomfortable, I don’t know what to say, you should’ve worked harder so it was you up here. [audience laughs, cheers] No, honestly, I never want to make people feel uncomfortable with that information. So much so that I used to lie to everybody. Growing up, I used to tell everybody that my parents were separated so I wouldn’t have to say my mom’s dead. And that worked very well until recently a friend of mine found out I had lied and she was very upset. [audience laughs] She was like, “Your mom’s dead? Taylor, you told me your parents were separated.” And I was like, “Well, they were! [audience laughs] By Jesus.” [audience laughs] Both her parents are alive, so she has no idea how funny that is but… [audience laughs] She’ll get it eventually, right? Like that joke is a slow burn. [audience laughs] Kinda like cancer, which is what got mine, hey oh! [audience laughs] Okay, alright. [audience laughs] [groans] Here’s the deal, Boston. [audience laughs] We have another, like, six minutes of dead mom jokes. [audience laughs] I know. You’re getting like, “Whoa, no, six minutes is a long time.” It won’t feel long. I have cushioned her, alright? [audience laughs] I have laid my dead mom to rest in a beautiful casket of dick jokes',\n",
              "  'and pop culture references. There’s something for everybody over the next six minutes. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll forget she’s dead. [audience laughs] But I know a lot’s happening for you as a crowd right now because you’re like, “Taylor, we’re good people. Good people wouldn’t laugh at dead mom jokes.” I’m here to tell you that if you’re trying to be a good person at a comedy show, you’re wasting your God damn time. [audience laughs] Trying to be a good person at a comedy show is like trying to recycle at a theme park. You’re already in here and part of the problem, put your hands up and have fun. [audience laughs] And I know you’re good people. You’re like, “Taylor, we’ve known you for 25 minutes. We hate that anything bad ever happened to you even once.” Thank you so much, Boston. But what you have to understand is the bad thing already happened and now I’m talking about it into a microphone in front of people who paid to be here, [audience laughs] which means now the bad thing is money. [audience laughs] Do you think I’d be this successful at my age if I had a live mom? [audience laughs] [audience whoops] [shouts] Fuck no! [audience laughs] I’d be a creative writing teacher who loved myself and I’d be sitting in the dark with you pheasants, okay? [audience laughs] She’s in heaven, I’m on Netflix, it all worked out. [audience cheers] That is a real thing I said in therapy. [audience laughs] To which my therapist responded, “You should come in twice this week.” [audience laughs] Some people get sad because I was eight when it happened. But eight is a great time to lose a parent because you’re so stupid, you barely know what’s going on. When I was eight, I was like, the only people I know with dead moms are Disney princesses. [audience chuckles] So like, this sucks but am I about to get hot? [audience laughs] Then I hit puberty and I was like, “Oh no, I guess God just hates me right now, that’s a bummer.” That’s a joke. God doesn’t hate anybody, alright? Not anymore. [audience laughs] But have you read the Old Testament? Holy shit. [audience laughs] The Old Testament is my favorite Taylor Swift album. It is… [audience laughs] It is banger after banger. Just like, “You don’t believe in me? [in singsong voice] Snakes! Look what you made me do.” [audience laughs] I’m a 20-something white woman, obviously, I’m gonna compare T. Swift to the Lord, alright? [audience laughs] She is the only god I still believe in, alright? [audience cheers] I don’t see God God revamping his old shit and let’s be honest, he probably should ’cause the people who own it now suck. [audience laughs, cheers] It does grow you up very quickly, losing a parent that young. I mean, I saw a dead body when I was eight which means I saw a dead body years before I saw a dick. And that is not the order that shit should go in [audience laughs] according to the American Girl Body book. [audience laughs] Although maybe it should be ’cause you know what’s crazy? A dick? Way more traumatizing than your dead mom. [audience laughs] Oh my God, it’s so much worse. I saw my mom, I was like, “That lady used to make me snacks, now she’s very still.” I saw a dick for the first time, I was like, “Oh my God! Who took Jabba the Hutt’s eyes? [audience laughs] You have done nothing for me. No, no, no. No, I didn’t say Beetlejuice even one time!” [audience laughs] I haven’t seen that many dicks and I don’t want to see any more and it’s nothing against men, I’m attracted to you for some reason but I swear to God, every time you see a new dick, there is an adjustment period, isn’t there? [audience laughs] Just a real quick like… [huffs deeply] and we’re back in it, alright. [audience laughs] I have stayed in relationships too long ’cause I just wasn’t ready to see a fresh one. I just couldn’t [audience laughs] couldn’t wrap my head around it, literally or figuratively. I just… I just didn’t have it in me, couldn’t have it in me. And… [audience laughs] I don’t care how many dicks you’ve seen, every time you see a new dick, it feels like jumping into a cold pool. Just like, [nervously] “Alright, let me just swim around, get used to this one.” “Okay, alright, this one’s deeper than the last one but that’s okay.” “That’s alright. This is why we take our arm floaties, you know, for moments like these.” [audience claps, cheers] [grunting] Just control your breathing, hot girl summer, bitch, you can do it. [audience laughs] I think of the genitalia options available, I think dick seem friendlier, you know. They’re up, they’re happy to see you, they’re wagging, I’ve never had sex. [audience laughs] It’s like a front tail, right? [audience laughs] I’ll Google it, it’s fine. It’s all speculation. I’ve never seen a vagina, not even my own, I’m a Christian. [audience laughs] But from what I hear, it is very spooky down there. It’s just a dark spooky hole, like, a hole? I’m sorry, what? Every time someone fingers me, I’m like, “You are very trusting, sir, because…” [audience laughs] “…I don’t even know where that goes.” “That might be where I keep the bipolar. That might be…” [audience laughs] “…where it has been… actually, if you see any, could you scrape it out?” “Could you…” [audience laughs] “…just like a mental health Pap smear?” “Can you just do…” [audience laughs] Don’t do that. Like, you gotta hook your finger, like when a baby’s choking, are you familiar? If you do that, it’ll push it in too far, it’s too late. But if you hook your finger, you swipe it, that’s how you get it out. [audience laughs] I like doing that joke because it goes too far but you do learn something that could save a life. [audience laughs] I just love the idea of years from now, someone being like, “If it weren’t for that dick joke, my niece would not be here.” [audience laughs] The craziest thing that',\n",
              "  'happened is my mom died of cancer. See? You almost forgot. [audience laughs] And then my dad got remarried and then our stepmom got cancer. She’s fine, don’t worry. I wouldn’t do that to you twice. [audience laughs] That’s God talking to my dad. And… As soon as our stepmom got it, me and my siblings were like, “Holy shit.” “Is Dad giving people cancer?” [audience laughs] We thought he was a carcinogen. We were like, “Don’t microwave anything for him.” [audience laughs] “I think that’s how he’s doing it.” If he had taken down a second one, we would’ve put a warning on his Christian Mingle account. Like bare minimum, just like, “Hey, chemicals in here have been known to cause cancer.” “Ride at your own risk.” [audience laughs] I feel like some people don’t believe me that she’s alive. She’s completely fine, you guys. She’s happy, healthy, great lady. We actually call my stepmom Mom because when my dad married her, nobody was using it. So we were like, “Yeah, be Mom, who cares.” [audience laughs] Oh, I’m sorry, if your principal quit and you got a new principal, they wouldn’t be like, “This is Lisa.” Like… [audience laughs] Let her be principal, there is an opening. [audience laughs] Also, we were so young when it happened and my dad got remarried so fast, I think he was kinda hoping he could just like Indiana Jones switch them out [audience laughs] before anybody noticed. You know when you’re a kid and your hamster dies and your parents don’t want to explain death to you so they just buy you a new one that looks the same and they’re like, “No, that’s Connie, she just bites now.” [audience laughs] That’s kinda what he did. But with moms. But I never used to talk about any of that, I never used to talk about my mom dying because I didn’t want to make people uncomfortable and also, like most of us with childhood trauma, should be pretty much everyone in here. If you’re sitting here tonight going, “I don’t think I have any, I have great parents, I had a good childhood and this ‘comedy show’? It’s not that fun for me.” [audience laughs] Good. [audience laughs] I hope this is the worst night of your whole life. [audience laughs] ‘Cause it sounds like it’s been smooth sailing [audience laughs] and you might need some perspective. Most of us did have some childhood trauma and when you get to be an adult, you’re like, “Woo, made it! Never have to think about that again. Look at all my keys. The world’s my oyster.” [audience laughs] And so you just start pushing all that dark stuff that happened to you as a kid down, down, down ’til you don’t even think about it anymore. And that works for a long time. [audience chuckles] Until one day, [audience laughs] you stub your toe really hard on a curb and you just start weeping uncontrollably in the street and you’re like, “Okay, this is about something else. [audience laughs] I was keeping all my trauma in that toe. [audience laughs] And then I jostled it and now it’s everywhere. [audience laughs] [whispering] Gone over here.” [audience laughs] And if you don’t deal with that stuff, it’s gonna keep affecting you in ways you are not even conscious of. I realized in therapy that because my mom died young, I have this irrational belief that I am also going to die young, so I’ve been living in a very intense unhealthy way my entire adult life where I’m like, I can’t take a break, I gotta be working all the time, I have to hit these goals and achievements, otherwise I’m nothing. I got engaged a few years ago ’cause I was like, “I gotta get married before I’m dead” which is a super hot way to propose to somebody. [audience laughs] I call it “The Walk to Remember,” it’s kinda my move and… [audience claps] It did not work out with my ex-fiancé. I hate that I have to say that word now. It sounds like a spell, doesn’t it? [shouting] Just like, “Ex-fiancé!” It’s terrible. [audience laughs] He and I are not friends, not ’cause he’s a bad person, he’s actually a very good person. I don’t know if you’ve dated someone right before they find out they’re bipolar but it is what is known as “The Lord’s work.” [audience laughs] I think I was a great partner if nothing went wrong. If nothing went wrong, I was like, awesome. But if one thing went wrong, total nightmare. Like, I was like those spikes you drive over when you’re returning a rental car. Like as long as you keep moving forward, everything’s great. But if you back up even a little, I will slash all your tires. [audience laughs] And then be like, “What? I put up a sign.” [audience laughs] And you’re like, “I know, I mean, I know I messed up a little but like this reaction seems cra… like other speed bumps don’t react like that.” And I’m like, “Then go be with her!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] We are not friends, my ex-fiancé and I, because I think it’s weird when exes try to be friends with each other and they’re like, “We’ll hang out, we’ll get fro yo.” You’re like, “Fro yo? I know what you taste like. I’m not gonna sample yogurt with you, [audience laughs] you psycho. Do they have Kevin after a run, do they have that flavor at Yogurtland?” They do, it’s salted caramel, but still. [audience cheers, claps] I went back home after I called off my engagement for whatever holiday doesn’t offend you and… [audience laughs] …a lot of my friends are settling down. Some of them are just settling, period, end of sentence. [audience laughs] You guys know those couples? Everyone knows one couple like that where like one person in the couple is way hotter and cooler than the other person in the couple. I like to call those couples chocolate-covered raisins. [audience laughs] Because you’re like sure, you could put those two together, if you want. [audience laughs] But every time you see them, you’re like, “Chocolate, what are you doing? [audience laughs] You could’ve been with',\n",
              "  'anybody. You could’ve been with caramel, you could’ve been with marshmallow, you could’ve been with peanut butter, who I heard cures depression, [audience laughs] and you want to be with raisin forever? Like, no offense, raisin, you’re great, we love you, nature’s candy, that’s you. But you belong with like oatmeal, like, you know that, right? This doesn’t feel good, right? Aren’t you scared every day that someone’s gonna come along and suck chocolate right off of you? [audience laughs] I love this joke ’cause I like to see couples in the audience looking at each other like, “Am I chocolate or raisin? [audience laughs] We’re both chocolate, right, babe? We’re chocolate-covered chocolate? We’re like those little Lindor guys in the foil, you know? I’m the creamy part and you’re the shell [sobbing] ’cause you’re so strong and if you leave me, I’ll be a mess.” [audience laughs] Some of you are like, “I am oatmeal and I am good with it.” [audience laughs] I made the mistake of talking to my happiest married friend after I called off my engagement, don’t do that. Your happiest married friend doesn’t remember what it’s like to be heartbroken. She’s like, “Well, what are you gonna do now? You’re gonna get back out there? Are you seeing anybody?” And I was like, “Nope, just gonna focus on my career for a little bit.” And she’s like, “Well, why can’t you focus on a career and a relationship at the same time?” And I was like, “How do I explain this [audience chuckles] in a way you might understand? [muttering] Why can’t I focus on a career and a relationship? Have you ever been on the freeway in traffic and your lane stops but the one next to you keeps moving, so you get in the one that’s moving, and as soon as you get in the one that’s moving, that one stops and the one next to you starts moving again. So you get back in that first one ’cause that one’s moving now and as soon as you get back in that first one, that one stops again and the one next to you starts moving. And after you go back and forth a few more times, at a certain point, you’re like, “Okay. Is it fucking me?” [audience laughs] And she’s like, “Yeah, I don’t know if I get it because you know, John and I, we usually just boop, get in the carpool lane. [audience laughs] And I was like, “Where’s your baby? Imma drop it!” [audience laughs] I actually did get into a new relationship pretty quickly after I called off my engagement. I wasn’t trying to, I really wasn’t. A lot of my friends were like, “You should stay single for a while. You should maybe get a cat.” And I was like, hard pass. I have never left an interaction with a cat feeling better about who I was. [audience laughs] Every cat reacts to people the way I react to seeing girls I went to middle school with in a Target. Just like… [audience laughs] [shouts] Oh, no! Like that’s every cat. [audience laughs] I don’t want to come home to that energy. [audience laughs] But I wasn’t looking for a relationship. I was trying to have like a fun, sexy fling which doesn’t usually go great for me because I have this round wholesome face that people think they should build a life with. [audience laughs] Every time I’m like, “We could bone or whatever.” Guys are like, “No, I’m alright but you could meet my mom, do you want to do that? You seem like you’d be better at meeting my mom than having sex.” And they are not wrong, alright? [audience laughs] I will meet your mom all night long. Moms like me so much for no reason. I was dating a guy years ago, we were totally on the rocks having problems, and I went to lunch with his mom hoping to get some advice, and halfway through lunch, she puts her hand on my hand and goes, “You know, Taylor, my son’s a lot like his father. [audience chuckles] And if I could go back in time, [audience laughs] I don’t know that I’d marry his father again.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Are you saving my life in this Panera Bread right now?” [audience laughs] It was like a movie when an older character sacrifices themselves for the good of the journey, like she Gandalfed me. She was like, “Fly, you fool!” [audience laughs] She was a bad mom and a bad wife but such a good friend, oh my God! Hoes before sons, am I right? [audience laughs] I think about her every day. And my boyfriend wasn’t looking for a relationship either when we met, straight dudes usually aren’t, you know. Women are surprised when they find a guy who can make them cum and straight dudes are surprised when they find a girl who can make them feel genuine feelings in their heart. Like women are like, “He got me off three times.” And guys are like, [in low voice] “I mean, I just fucking like her, dude. [audience laughs] [in low voice] Like we talked all day, I didn’t want to hit her, it was nuts! [audience laughs] She’s just like my friend. I don’t know, I want to like lick her heart, I think.” [audience laughs] Straight dudes are so proud of themselves for falling in love. It’s really cute. They’re like, [in low voice] “I love you. Hell yeah, buddy, I knew you could get there.” [audience laughs] Women fall in love, we’re like, “I love you. [whispering] Fucking again? You dumb bitch. [audience laughs] You were supposed to love you first, you keep skipping that part! [audience laughs] It is eat, pray, then love! [audience laughs] Oh my God. It’s okay, we’ll try again in a year and a half.” [audience laughs] My boyfriend is seven years older than me ’cause I needed to get back on my dad for some stuff. [audience laughs] Older guys are just better. They’re just better, you never have to ask them to buy Pepto Bismol, they just have it in the house. [audience laughs] They pull it out after dinner like a nightcap,',\n",
              "  'like, “You want some pink juice, baby girl?” You’re like, “Yes, I would, cheers.” [audience laughs] Older guys don’t call you things like “cute” or “hot.” They call you things like “stunning, gorgeous,” shit with syllables, things that would take a 20-something guy a little while to settle down. [audience laughs] And older guys aren’t like, cute or hot either. You know, they’re handsome, distinguished, like old pictures of your grandpa you shouldn’t look at too long. [audience laughs] You ever find one of those in an old dusty box? You’re like, “Who is that? Oh, that’s wrong. Okay.” [audience laughs] They’re not your family in those pictures yet. They’re just the past, it is a gray area. [audience laughs] Oh, I’ll get weirder. You ever see a picture of your parents when they were young and hot? And you get like weirdly mad ’cause you know they would’ve never dated you? [audience laughs] I saw a picture of my dad in college football once. I didn’t talk to him for three weeks. I’m like, “You would’ve left me at a drive-in, you Danny Zuko piece of shit!” [audience laughs] He’s like, “What?” I’m like, “I can’t hug you for a year and I don’t want to talk about it.” [audience laughs] It’s always awkward getting into a new relationship, though, especially right after you called off an engagement because you don’t feel like you can say any cheesy romantic crap ever again. Even if you feel it, you just feel like you’re a jinx. So when the next person is like, “I wanna be with you forever.” You’re like, “Oh, wouldn’t that be something? [audience laughs] I can’t… I can’t use the F-word anymore but I just need to build my credit back up but… [audience laughs] …samesies, bro, for sure.” New relationships are awkward ’cause you gotta tell a whole new person what you like in bed and the only reason you know what you like in bed is ’cause someone else did it to you first. [audience laughs] But you can’t say it like that, right? You gotta do that cute little tap dance of like, “Oh, babe, you know what would be so fun that’s never even occurred to me before?” “You know what your body is inspiring me to do right now?” But in your head, you’re just like, “Do it like Craig. Could you just…” [audience laughs] “Do it how Craig did it every time?” “Craig didn’t do shit right, he did that right, let me tell you.” “Can we just call him?” “Can we just call him and ask?” [audience laughs] “It’s not a big deal, we’re all adults here.” “Remember we reset the Wi-Fi router last month?” “It’s just like that, babe. He’s just a voice on the phone with the password.” [audience laughs] “That’s all he is to me now.” “No, I did block his number when you asked me to, of course I did.” “But when you block a number, your phone kinda just saves it in a different folder.” [audience laughs] Oh, some of us are gonna fight in the car, not everybody knew that. [audience laughs] You have to be able to talk about what you like in bed and you have to know what you can and can’t say, alright? Like I’ve been telling guys for years I like it a little rougher in bed. I don’t say it like that, I say like, “Oh, I’m damaged,” you know. [audience laughs] If you’re a straight guy, don’t say that. If a straight dude’s like, [in low voice] “I’m damaged,” fucking run! That guy… that guy wants your toes in a baggy. So… [audience laughs] Sometimes you think you like something and you don’t. I thought I like dirty talk, turns out, I just like dirty phrases we agreed upon earlier. [audience laughs] You ever tell someone you like dirty talk and then they hit you with something in bed and you’re like, “Nah, that was not approved by corporate, no.” [audience laughs] I was having sex with a guy once, I was on top and he just went, [shouting] “Look at you!” [audience laughs] [audience laughs, cheers] Like I was taking my first steps. [audience laughs] I’m like, “You better get the camcorder, daddy, ’cause I am never getting up here again.” [audience laughs] My parents don’t watch me do stand-up anymore, don’t worry. [audience laughs] Don’t worry, they’re not interested. No Christian parents want to watch their daughter talk about depression and dick for an hour. It’s not fun for them. [audience laughs] My parents don’t have a dark sense of humor and I do, and I’m glad I do because if you can laugh at the darkest stuff that’s ever happened to you while it’s still actively happening to you, sometimes that’s what gets you through it. For example, here’s a joke they will not like. [audience laughs] Did you guys know that sometimes when you call a suicide hotline and the call drops, they do not call you back? [audience laughs] Yeah, you think that’d be the time for star 69 but sometimes they just ring a bell in the cubicle, like, “Lost another one, that’s lunch!” [audience laughs] Some of you are tensing up like, “Did that really happen?” Yeah, a few years ago and it was fucking hilarious. I was on the floor of a DoubleTree Hotel, like, “Did this bitch just ghost me while I’m trying to ghost myself?” “That is…” [audience laughs] “I mean, I’ve been left on read, I’ve never been left for dead.” “That’s a new one.” [audience laughs] “That is brutal.” I wasn’t even mad. For all I know, that’s how they train those volunteers. Like, “Hey, some nights, we get too many calls. [audience laughs] Fridays are big for us, in those situations, you’re just gonna have to use your best judgment, alright? Like I usually wait for like a privileged white girl name, like a Chelsea, a Kelsey, a Taylor. Those are the salmon I throw back and hope they swim upstream on their own.” [audience laughs] Even if I was mad, what am I gonna do, hop on Yelp? Like, “One star, totally killed myself. [audience laughs] You’re gonna wish I killed myself after this review.” [audience laughs] I did that joke',\n",
              "  'in Texas a few weeks ago and there was a girl, white, my age in the crowd who goes, [shouting] “And the wait times are ridiculous!” [audience laughs] And she’s right, okay? I think, personally, I think if you are a frequent caller, there should be some sort of rewards program. You know, like when you show loyalty to an airline. Like, you should be able to do that with suicide hotlines where you call in and they’re like, [in robotic voice] “Please enter your rewards number.” Boop, boop, boop. “Welcome back… [sobbing] Taylor. [audience laughs] Thank you for your diamond medallion status. You are now third in line. Would you like to use an upgrade and kick someone else out? [audience laughs] My parents are still very, very religious. My dad was so religious growing up, he used to insist on praying out loud in restaurants before we ate dinner, which is fine if you’re into that but keep it short. [audience laughs] He wouldn’t do that. He would do long, drawn-out prayers full of personal details that none of us signed off on at the table which made puberty pretty rough with your dad in public just like, “Thank you Lord for this food. Thank you for bringing us here together. [shouting] Thank you that Taylor’s a woman now and is getting the help she needs in math.” I’m like, “Can you not tell this Chipotle that I’m bleeding and can’t subtract? [audience laughs] I think God knows.” It’s why I don’t feel bad telling jokes about my parents on stage now ’cause anytime they’re like, “Do you have to air our dirty laundry in front of strangers?” I’m like, “Hometown Buffet, 1998. [audience laughs] You told everyone within a five-booth radius that I shat my pants the night before. [audience laughs] I can say whatever I want. [audience laughs] I’m not religious anymore. I have had some friends find religion as adults recently which is very upsetting. [inhales deeply] [audience laughs] If you grew up religious and you’re not anymore and your adult friends find religion, it feels like God is your shitty ex-boyfriend who’s now getting it together for your friend and you just have to watch it happen on Facebook. They’re like, “Have you met God? He’s amazing.” I’m like, “Yeah, I grew up with God, he’s a douchebag, alright? Did he tell you you were broken and you need him? That’s his move. That’s what he does. [audience laughs] He says that to everybody. Don’t drink what he gives you. You drink that, the next thing you know, you’re eating his body, the holy spirit’s inside you, it’s a whole system they have over at that frat house they call church. [audience laughs] Who else uses Roman numerals?” [audience laughs] That joke makes it sound like I resent my religious upbringing and I do, so I nailed it. But… [audience cheers, claps] No, honestly, if I had to come up with some stuff that was like positive about my growing up religious, I’m sure I could with enough time and money but… [audience laughs] I do have some issues with it. It gave me some serious trust issues and it just made me weird, growing up in church, in ways that I am still discovering. For example, I just found out that I masturbate wrong. [audience laughs] I will back up. Okay, so… [audience laughs] When I was growing up in church, kids had youth group and at youth group, they were like, “Don’t have sex.” And we were like, “For sure, for sure.” And then, they were like, “Don’t even masturbate.” And all the girls were like, “Okay, we didn’t even know that we could.” [audience laughs] And all the boys were like, “Why?” And… [audience laughs] …the way they explained it to us was, our youth pastor told us, he goes, “It’s not the physical act of masturbating that’s the sin, you guys, alright? It’s not even the orgasm. In fact, if you have a wet dream, thank God for the freebie and have an awesome day. [audience laughs] But what are you thinking about while you’re doing that to yourself, guys? [scattered laughs] That’s what the sin is. It’s the lust in your heart. It’s the impure thoughts in your head. That is what the sin is.” So when I got to be an adult and I wanted to masturbate, I was like, “Well, if I just don’t think about anything, [audience laughs] I could probably still go to heaven, right? Just like, clear your mind, get in there, get it done, see you soon, Jesus, right? [audience laughs] Touch nothing but the lamb.” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] So I’ve been doing this my entire adult life. All my friends are like, “You gotta meditate.” I’m like, “I think I do.” [audience laughs] And I do mean my entire adult life, by the way. I did not masturbate until I was a grown woman. I was that afraid of going to hell, alright? Yeah. I had my first orgasm with my college boyfriend. Do you know how embarrassing that is to get your first orgasm from another person? That’s like having a realtor show you your own house. [audience laughs] They’re like, “And over here, we have a second bathroom.” You’re like, “A second bathroom?” [audience laughs] “You’ve been here for 19 years, you never went poking around on your own?” You’re like, “I did once but I thought Jesus would get mad, [audience laughs] so yeah, I don’t actually own this place, I’m just renting it from the guy upstairs, and… if I flood the basement, I do not get my security deposit back, so… [audience laughs] Is there anything else I should see while you’re here?” She’s like, “Yeah, let me show you the doorbell.” I’m like, “Oh, is the doorbell even important?” She’s like, “The doorbell is the only thing that matters. [audience laughs, claps] Nobody comes inside without touching the doorbell.” [audience laughs] “Oh, but I did touch it.” “You didn’t use enough pressure, it didn’t light up.” [audience laughs] So I’ve been masturbating like this my entire adult life and I recently mentioned it to a friend of mine and you ever say something out loud and realize you never should have ever?',\n",
              "  \"[audience laughs] I said it so casually over brunch, didn’t even think about it. I was like, “Oh yeah, I mean, I don’t think about anything while I do that.” And she was like, “What?” She put her fork down. “What? [audience laughs] You don’t think about anything?” And I was like, “Oh, no, I mean, I think some stuff, obviously. And she was like, “What do you think about?” And I was like, “Oh, you know, just like, ‘almost there, making good time.’ [audience laughs] You know, just like road trip thoughts, like… ‘keep your hands steady, don’t fall asleep. Can’t wait to get there so I can eat. [audience laughs] Better hurry up, Taco Bell’s gonna close, ‘ you know.” [audience laughs] And she was like, “That is so weird, Taylor, why don’t you just watch porn like a normal person?” And I was like, “Ugh, I don’t like porn.” Every time I try to watch porn, I’m just like, “You gotta shave there, too? [audience laughs] I’m tired and I’m cold.” And I’m not against porn, okay? I’m not one of these people that’s like, “If you watch porn, it will ruin your relationship.” I don’t feel that way, alright? I dated a guy once who was really into massage porn where the masseuse would like fuck their client at the end which means sometimes when we had sex, I get a massage! [audience laughs, cheers] That’s an example of porn working for you! [audience laughs] But my friend was like horrified. She was like, “Taylor, this like monk masturbation thing you do, [audience laughs] it is so much creepier and weirder than any porn I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen most of it.” [audience laughs] And she goes, “There are so many different options porn-wise on the internet now, you… just go home and Google ‘porn for women’ okay? Just do it, I promise, ‘porn for women.'” And so I went home and I googled porn for women so I wouldn’t be weird at brunch. [audience laughs] And a lot of surprising things came up when I googled it. First thing that came up when I googled porn for women was a link to Disney Plus where all the Avengers movies are. Now… [audience laughs] For me, personally, they jump around too much. There’s too many storylines. You’re almost there with Loki and now we’re on Captain America? It’s like, I have to start over. That’s a different speed, a different pressure and now there’s a raccoon? No. [audience laughs] The second thing that came up when I googled porn for women was a website where real-life couples are uploading amateur sex tapes. Yeah, real-life couples are like, “Hey, we’re so happy and in love, we thought that we would film ourselves making love and then put it online for you, a lonely person. [audience laughs] Is it working? Are you wet?” And you’re like, “Not in the right place, no. [audience laughs] But congratulations, what you have seems really special.” [audience laughs] The last thing that came up when I googled porn for women I did not know existed, it’s something called audio porn. It’s exactly what it sounds like. There’s no visual aspect, it’s all audio. It’s not really a porn star, it’s more like a porn voice actor talking you through a sexy situation. It’s like a podcast except don’t listen while you’re driving. [audience laughs] And because it’s “for women,” that just means there’s a story, right? Anyone can watch, they don’t check. [audience laughs] They don’t just hop on the mic like, [shouting] “Now it’s out, bitch!” Like they ease you into it. And so the one I found is 20 minutes long. I will send it to you if you DM me. [audience laughs] And the first 12 minutes, the story, is just a man calming you down [audience laughs] after you’ve been in a car wreck. [audience laughs] That is the foreplay. [audience laughs] And you guys, I came so hard. I… [audience laughs, claps] I mean, I didn’t even make it to the sex part. It was the comfort alone. He’s like, “It’s okay, take some deep breaths, don’t worry.” “The insurance companies will figure it out.” I’m like, “Oh my God, that’s right!” [shouting] “That’s why we have insurance!” By the time he was like, “What else can I do? Should I go down on you?” I was like, “Nah, man, I got Allstate, I’m in good hands.” [audience laughs] Thank you so much, Boston, you were absolutely amazing. [audience cheers] Thank you so much. I can’t tell you, I really appreciate you. Thank you. [upbeat music] [audience cheers] You guys were amazing. Thank you so much, seriously.

Theo Von: No Offense was recorded at the Civic Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana. The special was released on February 26, 2016. You can watch Theo Von: No Offense on Netflix. * * * Yo, Theo, they all ready for you, bro. Awesome, how do I look? Smart? Appreciate the honesty. Do it, huh? Go get ’em. [Announcer] With no further ado, ladies and gentlemen, Theo Von! New Orleans! Yes, indeed. How we doin’, Crescent City? [Applause] Good to be home, baby. Good to be home! My buddy said, “Dang, you going down to New Orleans to shoot your special?” I said, “Yeah!” He said, “What about that crime?” I said, “Yeah.” He said, “You might get murdered.” I said, “Yeah.” “But where else you want to get murdered, baby?” I don’t wanna get gunned down in Cleveland. I don’t wanna get gunned down in Seattle. Murder me in New Orleans, baby! Right off the French Quarter, with a stripper on my arm and a fried shrimp in my mouth! Good to be here, man. I love this city, and it is dangerous as hell. Last time I was here, I got bit by a black widow in March. She was in her 40s. At this bus stop, man. Right off Canal, bro. Got me right in the neck, son. These bitches is accurate. Been a tough time, man. Been a tough year… family stuff. You know, always, man. My uncle just got busted for, uh, uh… [inhales] sucking really small dicks. Yeah, they got him. He was my favorite uncle, man. He taught us how to masturbate, actually. He didn’t touch us or anything like that. He just stood up and jerked off into the fire at this party. I wasn’t gonna say anything. It was his party. Sometimes you just got to sit there and be a Christian. But in his defense, my uncle’s had a lot of issues in his life. He used to masturbate in his sleep. So… I’m not joking, man. So they made him wear these jingle bells on his wrists. But some nights you would hear him in the other room, dashing through the snow. You know what I’m saying, jerking his own dick off. I’d make requests. “Play ‘Rudolph’ Uncle Danny!” “Y’all go to bed!” You telling me this musical masturbator doesn’t take requests? What kinda family is this, bro? This family tree got haters in the branches. Lot of child molesters out there? No offense if you’re in the game. And now, it’s like a big deal, I feel like, if you get molested, you know. There’s Child Services, it gets on the news, it gets on the Internet. Like, when I was young, you just got molested. Remember that, bro? Remember the ’80s, dude? You just got molested! You got a milkshake and a ride somewhere. That was your end of the deal. When I was young, if you got molested, you just got back on your bike and said, “Well, we ain’t coming around here anymore. Nothing but dick around here.” Look, if I got a dollar for every time I got molested… I’d have like, four dollars and 50 cents. ‘Cause I got in this oral pyramid scheme by the Denny’s. Parents, you gotta be careful when it comes to these kiddy-touchers. You gotta be careful when it comes to these kiddy-touchers. You can’t be getting your son all fixed up. You can’t be getting your boys lisp fixed. Get his acne tightened up. Get the pro-action on him. Get his limp fixed. And then be shocked when he gets picked by the kiddy-touchers! Fuck, you got him all G’d out. You know who ain’t getting picked, is little Ch-Ch-Charlie’s ass, okay? Who still got his lisp, who got his acne, who got a wrap his bad leg around his good leg when he wanna go somewheres. Nobody touchin’ little Ch-Ch-Charlie’s ass. You gotta think like the enemy. Save your money, give it to your boy in a lump sum when he’s 18. Let himself G’d out when he’s out of the danger zone. Think about life. Good to be home, man, I was born about eight blocks from here, bro. So it’s nice, man. I had an interesting family growing up. My father was 70 years old when I was born, okay. True story. I’m not joking, my dad was born in 1910. I was born in 1980. Which basically makes me a stand-up comedian. It was kinda cool growin’ up with a dad in his 70’s, because of the time we would spend. Shortly after I was born, my dad had a stroke. So, we were both learnin’ to walk at the same time. We used to play games like catch or don’t. And my favorite: “Is Dad sleeping, or is he no longer with us?” “It’s your turn to hold the mirror under his nose.” My mom used to make us hold a mirror under his nose when he was taking a nap to see if it would fog up or not. I swear to God, not joking. And the kids at school would be like, “Well, my dad could beat up your dad.” I’d be like, “No shit, man.” Your dad has more organs than my dad… but my dad used to bang your grandmother. Back before they had protection, when all you wore was hope. “You got any condoms?” “No, but I got this',\n",
              "  'here.” That’s that Alabama birth control, baby. And it’s crossin’ state lines. And my friends are like, “Theo, you shouldn’t make fun of your conception. You should be happy you were born. You were that lucky sperm.” I’m like, “Lucky sperm? I shot out of a 70-year-old cannon, bro.” I was the only sperm. I had to shut down the nuts. I had to close all the windows, fuckin’ sweep up. On the way out, I passed a skeleton of a sperm wearing a “Vote for Lyndon B. Johnson” button. That’s not an orgasm. That’s musket fire. So when I say I’m happy to be somewhere, I’m just happy to be. Anywhere. Except at Denny’s. They a bunch of child molesters over there. Y’all got Denny’s here? Yeah. Yeah! Fuck Denny’s, bruh. Fuck Denny’s, man. I wish people would quit shootin’ up movie theaters and shoot up a fuckin’ Denny’s, okay. ‘Cause if you get gunned up at a Denny’s, that’s on you, playboy. Have some respect and take your family to IHOP like a real man. Denny’s suck. Everything at Denny’s tastes like eggs and onions. Everything. The air, the pie, even the silverware if you just run in there and lick ’em. That place is a shithole. What do they clean the tables with? Syrup? Like once you sit down, you can’t even get up. “Guess we’re staying for lunch. I’m trapped!” And all the waitresses look like shit at every location. How do they do it? They even have a job application? Or they just have like a special mirror, and if you look like shit… then you’re on staff, Cynthia. But you gotta wear a hat, ’cause nothing looks better than shit in a hat! “Put on your hat, shitty. Waffle up.” Fuckin’ hate Denny’s, bro. And half the waitresses got whiskers. Would you shave your ladies, Denny? Shave your ladies before you put them on the dance floor. Lady look like a damn cat. “Meow! Meow! Meow-come to Denny’s! [Cat sounds] Sorry for the bad service. I just gave birth to a bunch of babies in a cardboard box in the kitchen. And we’s all out of milk.” Fuckin’ hate Denny’s, bro. I hate Denny’s, and I keep going back there! I keep going back. This me every time I leave Denny’s. “Man, fuck this place, man.” A week later, “Yes, ma’am, table for one, please. By the window? Yes, ma’am, thank you. Yeah. In case there’s a drive-by, I go down with this shithole. Thank you.” Fuckin’ hate Denny’s, man. Oh, I don’t know why it just makes me so mad. I gotta quit going, man. I’m gonna quit. I used to go a lot ’cause my ex-girlfriend lived by a Denny’s, ’cause she was a drug addict. And… and so, I used to go there and use the shitters, ’cause I didn’t wanna use ’em by her house. So I’d go use Denny’s shitters. But not anymore, man. Fuck that, dude. I’ll shit outside, son, like one of God’s boys. Turn up. What else is going on, man? Just been chasin’ these hos, really. No offense, hos. Just trying to meet a good lady. I see some of y’all got one. Good on you. Some lovely ladies here tonight. It’s tough, you gotta have money these days to get a woman. And I don’t blame you ladies. Who wants to fuck some poor guy? That’s nasty. You get done banging, you’re just laying there all poor. “Can I get you a towel that won’t match any of the other towels? What about some chips? Wanna split a bag of chips with daddy? Some chips, baby. Wanna calorie up after that bang, wildcat?” Gotta have money to get the ladies, man. You gotta have nice shit. I don’t have nice shit. I got the other shit. I don’t have a nice apartment. This is how I cheat, I put all my nicest stuff right by the door, right? So it looks nice when you come in. “Yeah, just step over that new toaster! Nice! Just set your purse by that Sopranos box set. Haters welcome.” [Audience member] Yep! I don’t have a nice car. I have that car where you act like you don’t remember where you parked, but you’re standing right next to your car. And when nobody’s looking, you fuckin’ get in and you escape. It looks like you’re stealing your own car. You tell your friends it’s a rental. They’re like, “They’re renting ’97 Accords to people?” Like, “Yeah, I’m just driving it for charity, actually, yeah. Yeah, every time I floor it, a blind boy can see four seconds. So he gets that pop, you know. So, I get a lot of speeding tickets, you know, for his little dark ass.” No offense, if anybody is blind either. My friend Maurice is blind, and he said it ain’t that bad in there. But you gotta have money to get the ladies. If you don’t have money, you gotta have the other money: drugs. Especially in L.A., man, that’s where I live now. Them girls out there a bunch of coke-ghosts. That’s what I call them. Coke-ghosts, baby, ’cause they’re invisible. They don’t answer your calls, your texts, but you break out a little bag of snow-caine, they fuckin’ show up out of thin air. Like, “Blow! Blow!” Then they’re angry when you wanna get ’em in the sheets. I’m like, “Bitch, you’re a ghost! This is your natural attire. Now come to daddy.” And if you don’t have money or drugs, you gotta be yourself. Fuck that, man. Last thing I’m doing is being myself. Not on my watch! What am I gonna say to a girl? “Hey, my name is Theo. Mostly, I just Netflix and keep my hopes up.” You’ll be alone forever! But these days you don’t have to be yourself ’cause they have Internet. You can be whatever you want. You could be a pineapple. You could be dead. You can be whatever you want, man.',\n",
              "  'I met a girl recently online. I hit her up, I said, “Let’s get some coffee.” So, she write me back. She said, “Coffee’s boring. Didn’t you read my profile? I’m adventurous. I wanna go skydiving on our first date.” [Whines] And nowhere in my budget is there skydiving-for-unknown-bitches money. That shit ain’t hittin’ my bottom line. I keep unknown bitches at sea level. So, I wrote her back. I said, “Well, listen here, fancy, I happen to live on the 11th floor of my building. Why don’t you come over here, I’ll assist you off the balcony in a windbreaker. If you’re still feeling all adventurous down on the flower beds, I’ll get your newly-crippled ass a coffee, then. But the caffeine ain’t gonna save your legs, you greedy little gremlin.” And now I’m angry. Now, I’m angry at a woman that I’ve never even met. Thanks, Internet! Do you know what it’s like to be angry at bitches you don’t even know? My buddy Sherman’s like, “What’s wrong?” I’m like, “This bitch!” He’s like, “Who?” I’m like, “I don’t know! Invisible bitches, Sherman! She’s a skydiver. Let’s wait for her ass.” “How will we know when she gets here if she’s invisible?” “I don’t know! Wait till you feel ‘bitch’ in the air. That’s probably her!” He’s like, “Relax, Little Bear. You need to go to yoga, Little Bear.” “Quit fuckin’ callin’ me ‘Little Bear,’ Sherman. Little bears ain’t in their 30s, you idiot.” I get frustrated, man. I get frustrated real easy, you know. You ever get frustrated, man? [Man] All the time. How do you relax? You don’t? [Laughing] Okay, right on. You just gon’ keep stressing till you pop, huh? That’s one way to do it, man. Gets you to heaven. But, yeah, it’s hard, man, it’s hard to relax. I’m not good at it, man. I tried the marijuanas. I know a lot of people’s on the marijuanas. And I’m not good at ’em, man. I get high, I just get real paranoid, you know? It’s like my whole head turns into a haunted house. I’m like, “What the fuck was that? Oh, an idea. This shit’s strong, man.” Then I tried yoga. I don’t know if you’ve been to yoga. I don’t know if you’ve been to this deal. Okay? If you haven’t been, it’s like… It’s like fuckin’, but by yourself, real slowly. And it’s awkward ’cause all the ladies in there are sweatin’ out of their crotches a little bit. What is the deal, ladies, huh? Somethin’ bit you? What happened, huh? What is going on? Put a little powder in your pants before you go in there. Starch up! Starch up, drink a Red Bull, “G” up! What, you hide an armpit in your crotch? Get your life together! Huh? Huh? Wear a cup, we don’t care. Just get it together. What if I went around just frothing at the balls all day like I had a little St. Bernard living behind my nuts? “Get back there, buddy. Get back there.” “G” up, ladies. They need to quit marketing yoga to dudes. Yoga ain’t for dudes. “Hey, bro, want to do a bunch of shit you couldn’t do?” “Fuck, no, you creep.” Touch my feet. I ain’t touching my feet. That’s why God put ’em down there, so I wouldn’t be messing with ’em, you little sinner. Yoga ain’t for dudes, man. If my grandfather walked in on six of his friends stretching at the same time, he’d hit ’em with a fucking shovel, okay? This shit ain’t Christian! “You men are stretching and don’t even know each other’s names! What are you doing? Look at your life!” Then they have some guy who works in the yoga studio. He looks like he got fired from a Renaissance fair. He’s like, “You’re doing a great job.” I’m like, “Who in the fuck are you?” He’s like, “Open your hip.” “I’ll shit on your linoleum. I will shit in here, bro. I shit places, okay? Don’t make me make this one of ’em.” Yoga ain’t for dudes. You want a yoga class for dudes, here’s the class, all right? It’s called “Simon Says Don’t Fart.” That’s the class. It lasts three minutes. Every man farts, admits to it, introduces themselves to the other men in the room, looking them square in the eyes, and leaves out of there with Christ in his heart. Not this other cat factory they’re runnin’. I hate fartin’. I do. I always have. I always have, okay? I just hate it. I just don’t– I can’t believe it, man. Can you believe we’re still fartin’? We’re farters. We think we know somethin’? We’re farters. We have air flyin’ out of our ass when it wants to. What the fuck, people? I have an app on my phone that can take my blood pressure, but my asshole’s still livin’ in the Wild West. If Apple would spend a half hour on our sphincters, we wouldn’t have this problem! Bring back Jobs! I hate farting, man. It’s like your booty trying to tell everybody all your secrets. It’s like, “Don’t smell that, you’ll know everything!” The worst is when you’re by yourself, living life at your house, and you’re alone in the living room and you fuckin’ cut a little bud up into the air, son, ’cause you know what’s up, ’cause you’re probably going to heaven. Then somebody comes in the room ’cause they wanna “tell you somethin’.” Now you gotta smell it all up before they get close to you like– [inhaling, exhaling] “Hey, Danny!” You try to talk so loud, they can’t smell. “How are ya? Let’s go talk by the wall. We never do that! Let’s chat outside. It’s raining? Who cares! We’re young!” I hate fartin’. We gotta beat it, man. We gotta beat it. I think we will. Who even invented fartin’? You ever ask yourself? Or you’re just fuckin’ fartin’, you creeps. Probably somebody from Mississippi, okay? I don’t know if',\n",
              "  'you guys have ever been to Mississippi or not. If you haven’t, let me save you a little bit of travel cash, okay? Go home, urinate in your toilet, and then get in there with it. “Ooh! Mississippi!” That place is a shithole, man. They need to give it to the Palestinians and solve a damn world problem, okay? They still have slaves there! I was there a month ago, I’m pumpin’ gas at the gas station, a brother pops out of the bushes, he’s like, “You got any news from the North?” Like, fuck this place, dude! We need to get Morgan Freeman out of there and then bomb that place. Not with bombs, but somethin’ that’ll really scare ’em: books! [Shouting] “Algebra!” Fuckin’ hate Mississippi, man. No offense if you’re from Mississippi either. I don’t know anymore, man. I just don’t know what God wants us to do. [Sighs] So then I decided I gotta get off the Interwebs. I was trying to meet a woman on the Interwebs. Electrical humans. And I said I gotta meet a woman the old-fashioned way. People interaction. I said I’m gonna ask out the next woman that I see to practice asking a woman out, to practice ridin’ the bike, ’cause I forgot what it was like. So I met a girl, she had a brown tooth. Just one, haters. But I’m a Christian. I’m gonna see the rest of her, see what else the Lord has built around this little shantytown in her mouth, around this little neck Bethlehem. I don’t know her life. Maybe she got hit by something brown right in the tooth. Maybe somebody had something brown and they threw it somewhere and she was somewhere and she got hit by it. Okay. I don’t know her life. “Knock, knock.” “Who’s there?” “Her life.” “I don’t know you, bro.” So I asked her out, right? [Laughing] She said no. I was like, “You’ve got a brown tooth, lady! Your face is dying! Your face is dying, okay? You’s a couple candies from being a jack-o’-lantern, you little sugar hooker. At least let me take you out for a salad, girly. Get some baby carrots in your mouth. Get some vitamins in your system. Get your grill back on its feet.” ‘Cause who am I supposed to ask out, if somebody whose face is rottin’ off their body is saying no? Huh? A headless woman? Where am I gonna meet a headless woman, huh? A headless woman who just wears her hat on her neck stub and goes to the bank? How am I supposed to be romantic with a headless woman? We’re at a nice restaurant, I’m just cutting a little piece of steak and just… just shaking them into her neck hole? It ain’t right. And I ain’t being gay, man. There’s already too many gays out there. How many gays are out there, bro? [Man] A hundred million. No, not a hundred million. Are you crazy, dude? Bro, they would be– They’d be under everything, man. Bro, no. Not a hundred million. Maybe eighty thousand. Ninety thousand. Maybe. With Obama in office, who knows? He’s probably… buying gays from other countries, maybe… Yeah. Probably gettin’ a bunch of Chinese gays soon. We don’t know, is what I’m saying. We don’t know how many people this monkey bit, guys. We got no idea. And here’s the kicker. Science still thinks one monkey did this. Uh, hello, science. Couple of monkey’s did this, okay? No offense if you’re gay either. I mean, I’ll probably suck a little dick at about 80. Know what I’m saying, bro? You suck a little dick at 80? Come on man, you in? Huh? What’s it for? For suckin’ dick! At 80, bro? You busy? You’re not doing nothing at 80, just sitting by the window. Wherever you go at 80, they put you by the window. “Put Pop-Pop by the window! Pop-Pop’s here, put him by the window!” They don’t even fucking ask Pop-Pop. Any fucking window, they just wheel you over to it. “That’s Pop-Pop. That’s your window.” You ain’t gonna wheel back one day and huff your boy off once? Add a little flavor to Pop-Pop’s life. Come on, man. It’s not gay at 80, bro. It’s chill. It’s just like, “Grandpa is crazy. But he’s staying active.” What you worried about, the feeling? You’re not gonna feel it. At 80, bro, you’re not gonna feel it, man. You’ve got no feeling left in your mouth at 80! All your feelings gone to heaven. Everything just feel like a warm water. Probably like somebody trying to sneak a fish stick into your mouth. “Who’s trying to give me this fish stick? Old Pop-Pop didn’t order no fish sticks!” It’s probably like eating a hot dog that’s fighting back a little. Come on, man. You afraid to suck a little dick? That’s the gayest thing I’ve heard. You’ve changed, man. Being gay has changed, man. Being gay’s changed. Now gay dudes are just like, “I’m gay!” That’s fine. It’s the way it always should have been. Let’s not forget the OGs of the game, baby. Let’s not forget our fathers and stepfathers, who’d meet up behind Shoney’s on their lunch break and tug uglies and go back home to their fucking families and kids. Let’s get a round of applause for those men. The OGs, baby. The Original Gays. Some guys are too gay these days, though, bro. Super gays, the kind of gay dudes where even my gay friends are like, “This bitch needs to chill out a little.” This guy came up to me the other day in L.A., man. He had all his stuff in an Easter basket. He had his phone and monies in an Easter basket. And he said he’s lost, he needs directions. I said, “I can’t help you get anywhere, bro, not if you frikking bringing your own Easter.” You can always find a super gay dude. And it’s always a frikking white',\n",
              "  'dude. And he’s always standing somewhere like this. And he’s always in a troubled neighborhood. And he’s standing there like this. [Shivering] Like people are beating him with soft cold dicks, but nobody’s beating him with soft cold dicks! It’s in his brains. And he’s got on Daisy Dukes, but more Daisy than Duke. Okay? And he’s got bright white legs, like, Boo-Radley white, like tall sacks of soft cream holding him up. And he don’t even look like a fellow. He looks like a premature baby somebody stretched up real tall and put a little tank top on him. And it looks like he don’t even have a spine in his body. Like, in the morning he was down like this in a little pile. And then he just… [inhales] caught a whiff of dick in the distance, and it’s been holding him up all day long. Like, come on, bro. That’s super gay, right? What if I went around just being super fucking straight all day? I just woke up and started throwing footballs at hot bitches all day long. Or eating raw meat and shitting in race cars? They would take me to jail. But bro-bro’s doing BYO Easter, and I gotta act like everything is normal? Come on, man! Just be regular gay, man. You didn’t win somethin’. ‘Cause we’ve all been a little gay, bro. You’ve been there? Just nod. I’ve been gay, bro. I’ll tell you about it, man. First time I was gay, I was 11 years old, okay? The only time that I was 11. And I was at the movie theater in my town. I grew up in a small town called Covington, Louisiana, not far from here, okay? You know it? Beautiful place, man. Beautiful place. Lee Harvey Oswald went to our middle school. True story. Pistol Pete Maravich lived and died in our town. So… two good shooters. Tulane University had their primate testing facility center in town, and in 1994, 70 infected monkeys got out, and they let us out of YMCA summer camp to help the police look for them. So what the fuck have you done with your life? Until you and 11 kids you barely know in wet bathing suits have surrounded six chimpanzees outside of a Kenny Rogers Roasters, you probably really don’t know yourself. I’m at the movie theater in our town. I’m there with my girlfriend. She looked like a boy. But that’s not the gay part of the story, is it, conclusion-jumpers? She looked like a boy because they only had one haircut in our town because Mr. Ray was our bus driver. On the third Thursday of the month, he would park the bus on the way home. You had three dollars, you would hold your money up. He was also the barber. He would clip everybody out that had their monies up. He only knew one hairstyle. It was kind of like this Polish lesbian cut. Anyway, that month me and my girl had a bit of spending cash and we were sitting at the movie theater. Our shit’s fresh. Now, the movie that had come to town was called Pumpkinhead. A scary movie. It was a film built for fear. So we’re sitting there, just ready to be scared. There’s an older boy sitting next to me. He was 16 years old. During the film, he got himself a hand job from his girlfriend, and he ejaculated onto my arm. It was a pretty decent amount. And I only had 11 years worth of arm at the time, so it looked like more then. But he really doused me up. And I was like, “Holy shit, man. They got me,” you know? “I’m gay.” So… I’m not joking, man. For three months, I thought I was a young homosexual. You know? And I broke up with my girlfriend. I started jogging. And then I’m sitting there at Christmas, I’m crying and wearing all these scarves. I’m serious, man. My brother is like, “What the fuck, dude? Mom’s pissed you’re wearing all her scarves.” I was like, “I’m a young homosexual, man. We’re just trying to live our lives.” He’s like, “What are you talking about?” “They were getting people at Pumpkinhead. And they got me. Where were you?” He’s like, “I don’t know if you’re gay or not, but you’re the dumbest person I’ve ever met in my life.” Then he beat my ass, actually. Is that a hate crime? I think I got hate-crimed, dude. I knew I thought I got hate-crimed. But here’s the wild part of that story. Here’s where the Lord really steps in. Because the fellow that got ejact onto me… he died. He died. He died. He died. [Repeats] He died. He died… He died in a car accident. He died of natural causes by a car. Sometimes I’ll be sitting somewhere… thinking or not thinking about something, waiting for a thought to come and find me. And I’ll feel like… Let me say this right. I will feel like… this is, like, his arm a little. I swear to God, man. Because I’ll just be sitting there doing nothing, or maybe doing something. And my hand will go like that. But I won’t want nothing. But it’s like he wants something. Like he trying to get something. Like he wants a candy. ‘Cause I wouldn’t be reaching for no candies ’cause I know we don’t keep candies in the house. It’s like he’s reaching for a candy, like, he trying to get a butterscotch. The second time I was gay was when I met Brad Pitt. ‘Cause I met Brad Pitt, dude. I did. I met Brad Pitt. The real one, the only one God ever made. Met his ass, okay? This is what happened. Listen up, haters. So it’s a beautiful day out. ‘Cause Brad only lives on beautiful days. And I’m walking. I’m going to an audition on the Fox lot in Los Angeles. Probably for a big movie',\n",
              "  'like League of their Own II or something heavy. The sun is hitting me while I walk. The rays are just coming down and just touching me on my neck and hair. Like the Lord just petting me, letting me know I’m still his boy. In the distance I see a man, right? I say a man, but I’m talking about the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen wrapped up in a man. He didn’t even look human. He looked like… Poseidon had been raising a secret little baby boy down in the ocean. And when that boy was full grown, he set him on the land and said, “Go, boy. You live out there now.” Immediately, I was gay. Okay? Like– Poof– Gay. So, I’m walking and he’s walking, we’re both going to the same building. It’s a true story. I don’t even know if Brad Pitt even walks anymore, or if there’s an agreement now between gravity and Mother Nature and the grace of God, where they just amicably move little Bradley wherever he needs to go. Like, God has a chessboard with one piece and it’s Brad-fucking-Pitt. Checkmate life, right? So, I’m walking, he’s gliding. We’re both going to the same building, I’m looking at him, and I’m thinking to myself, “Man, that looks like Brad Pitt.” And then my brain goes, “‘Cause that is Brad Pitt, playboy.” Part of my brain is black and gets a little ‘hood with the rest of my brain. I don’t know what to do now, ’cause they don’t teach you what to do when you’re about to meet Brad Pitt. They teach us other things. If you’re on fire, little buddy, stop, drop and roll. If you’re going to argue with a short man, don’t argue with him in a prone position. Argue with him like this and be ready for his little actions. But they don’t teach you how to meet Brad-frikking-Pitt in Brad-frikking-person, right? So I’m walking, he’s gliding. We’re going to the same building, me and the only Brad Pitt God ever made. Brad Pitt. And he was wearing– He was wearing everything. He had on, like, a tuxedo. And he was on a horseback. And he had on furs, but, like, exotic furs. Animals we’ve never even seen, like, Chimpanebras and alapacakeets. And he had Lorax coming off his shoulders, and he had Care Bear cuff on his boot-tops and wrists. And… he had no shirt on. So he’s coming from that way, I’m coming this way. Double doors on the building. We get to the front of this building at the same moment, and I’m thinking to myself, “I’ll get the door, ’cause Brad’s done a lot for me.” So I grab the door on the left and I pull it. You know how some asshole always locks the door on the left? That asshole works here. Okay? So, I pull it and it’s locked. Usually, you would just open the other door, but for some reason, I just keep pulling on this locked door like it’s gonna start up and I’m-a mow the yard with it, right? And Brad Pitt is standing right here. The only one that God has. And you can feel him when he’s standing somewhere ’cause he’s got this invisible energy comin’ off him, ’cause he’s made out of vagina and diamonds. So, I’m pulling on this door and he goes, “You got it, man?” ‘Cause that’s what Brad Pitt say when shit ain’t going well. So I look back at him like this. If you ever looked right at him up close, it’s like staring directly into the sun, but with a little bit of Brad Pitt in there. I look back at him like this and I say, “I got it, man.” That’s what my brain said. My mouth goes… [stuttering] Right to his face! [Stuttering] Like an Asian that won’t start. [Stuttering] Thankfully he speaks [stuttering], ’cause he’s been around social roaches like your boy. I gotta open door number two, but I don’t want this interaction to end. We might hug, we might fuck a little. This is Hollywood, son. This is my chance with Brad-frikkin’-Pitt, you animals. So, door number two, okay? Naturally, I could just open that door, walk in this building, let this man live his life. Or I could open the door for him, let him walk by and just live my own life. But this is what I did. I open the door. As it swings open, I jump across and put my back against the open door. Like, a way that people don’t open doors. He looks at me like, “That ain’t how people open doors.” And I said, “I got it, man. I used to work at a door store.” I’m not joking man, I door-stored him. Right to his face, dude. Right to his Brad Pitt face. And… and he goes… “Ha-ha.” That’s what he said. “Ha-ha.” And I don’t know if you ever heard him laugh in person, but I mean, it’s beautiful. You don’t even hear it at first. You just feel the laughter on your skin. When you finally hear his laugh, I mean, it just… it sounds like a million babies eating cookies at the same time. Right when I heard his laugh, crop circles formed in my hair. And memories of making love to a hundred women I never even met starting living in my heart. Mi corazón. So I’m just standing there against this door, right? People are going in and out. I’m just reduced to a concierge by this man. This lady comes runnin’ up, this straight-up street beast, and she’s like, “Did Brad Pitt just go in there?” I was like, “No, ma’am. He went thattaway,” you know? ‘Cause I ain’t telling this bitch where I keep him. Thank you. Thank you. And the third time I was gay was just a general time. When I was younger we used to play a game called “gay chicken.” Anybody in the',\n",
              "  'Navy? Uh… Homosexualis con pollo. It’s like, you and your buddy stand there, hold each other’s penis, all right. First person to let go is gay. But, if you get an erection, you’re out. So you got to play offense and defense, bro. The worst is when you start catching their pulse a little. “Why you pump faking, homie? You pump faking.” You can’t play with the brothers. You use both hands… hard on the back, L5-S1. And you can’t play with a Asian guy, ’cause you can’t… You just gotta pinky swear with it. That’s a different game, that’s called “broken promises.” That’s for the young bucks. That’s for the young bucks, man. I was 11-7 in ’92 actually. I was, man. They shut us down, though. Too many people watching. Fire hazard. I was having a tough time meeting a good gal, my buddy said, “Let me set you up on a blind date.” I said, “All right man, I can’t drive my own life. You drive it.” So, he set me up, and I got there early, I’m ready to fuck a little. And I’m just waiting for this girl, and then finally I see this girl. I’m like, “Oh, man, I could’ve met this bitch myself.” She was busted-looking, okay? No offense if you’re ugly. But she looked busted-up. She looked like she been beaten up by animals. She been on a new TV show called Bear Beatings. It was a two-part episode. At the end of the first part, it was like, “Will these bears continue to beat this bitch?” And the sequel was like, “These bears are still beating this bitch!” I’m not saying I look like anything special. I look like Patrick Swayze and Shrek had a son. Okay? I look like The Grinch That Stole Matt Damon. ♪ You’re a mean one, Jason Bourne ♪ If you look at me from the side, I look like I have bit of Down Syndrome. I can make that joke ’cause I actually beat Down Syndrome in 1991. I’m in remission. Praise God, baby. Amen. That’s where I’m from, dude. I’m from a neighborhood where if you had a handicap, you better get your shit together, get back on the street and make money. Toughest kid I’ve ever known was this boy named Dairy, named after the food group. He was, yogurt and all. He had Down Syndrome, wore a Scottie Pippen jersey and a gold chain every day of his life and carried a fucking gun, son. “If he ain’t got the money, then pop, pop. Pop-pop!” I’m not joking, dude. He killed seven pets in our neighborhood one year. He killed seven pets, bro. There ain’t much you can do when you got a DS fella spraying off against animals. We would call the police. They’d say, “Y’all can’t call us. Call a church. That boy is out of our jurisdiction, praise God.” What was I talking about? Oh, the girl on the date. So, this girl looked wild, bro. You know, visually freelance. Um… Her eyes were real far apart. I don’t know if that’s a new thing, ladies. I’m old-fashioned, I like more of a localized face. You know, just… Just holdin’ a little meetin’ by your nose, you know. Her eyes were just real far apart, you know, like she wanted to be greedy and see everything. The last second, the Lord just went “tink” with one of her eyes. The whole time I’m talking to her, I don’t know which eye to look into. I’ll just look back and forth into each eye, like it’s a threesome, but it’s just us. “So good to see you– What the fuck? Was your daddy a salmon?” Ladies, if your eyes real far apart, give your girlfriend an eye marker, tell her to draw a little more eye on the inside of each eye. Or draw a third eye in the middle. Play “guess which two I’m seeing out of” with your mans. Help each other out. This lady had strong breath, too. Kinda breath like– “Whoo! Kill ’em!” Strong, bro. Just like– Like one of her lungs hooked to her asshole. You’re like, “Come on now. Come on, Jannie, you’re talking booty.” Strong, bro. Made me nervous. Ladies, if your friend have strong breath, you have a responsibility. Get a little handful of mints or cinnamons. Run by your friend, throw them at her face like that. Or be more secretive about it, like that. Okay? See if some get in her face holes. Or get a syringe full of peppermint, sneak up behind Smokey, Dexter her in the neck. Start at the roots, work your way up. Help each other out, ladies. Teamwork makes the dream work, okay? This girl had a big head on her, too. She real, real, real extra-headed. I’m old-fashioned, I like a regular-headed woman. I like a basic think piece. She was real extra-headed, like her neck had been in a go-catch-something-big contest. Hurry, you’re missing all the big stuff! Like the Lord had taken her regular head off and dipped it in some breading and then put it back on her neck. Made me nervous, man. Why is my buddy even setting me up with a big-headed girl? I already have a big head. What are we supposed to do? Have a big-headed little child? Can’t even lift his beautiful little bitty big-ass head. It’s too heavy for his body to get off the ground. He gotta learn to crawl side to side, around it. He gotta play a clock in all the school plays. Don’t hook somebody up with the same shit they already have. If you got a one-legged friend, don’t hook him up with another one-legged friend. What do think? They’re just gonna lean against each other somewhere where it’s level? Fuck no, man! Two people need at least three legs! Look at a leg chart, you animals! And ladies, if you got a big head, work your head out. Do',\n",
              "  'some laps around yourself, like that. Put on some head Spanx. Spank your head up. Spank your head up, mama. I don’t know if you guys know what a Spanx are, it’s a special suit they made for the ladies. I think the Germans made it. It pushes all their body into their shoes, okay? I call it “cramouflage.” But we don’t notice that, we just see the “ba-bow.” We don’t see these tug boots, carryin’ the rest of ’em. Like– [boat-like sounds] Goin’ to the club. [Boat sounds] We just see the “ba-bow,” you know? Look like a sweet little vase you wanna put all your dick flowers in. Then you get her home, you crack off these Spanx, it’s like opening up a can of refrigerator biscuits. Like– [popping] Like, “I-I’m just gonna jerk off in the can. I’m tired, I got a headache. My headache’s tired. I love you.” But we hooked up. Uh… Sometimes you gotta take one for the team, even if you was a free agent. We hooked up, actually I was worried I mighta got her pregnant ’cause the birth control I was using, aim… doesn’t always work so well, you know. I didn’t want to have a baby with her, ’cause I don’t even know her, which should hold up in court. “Yes, Your Honor, this is our boy, Headrick, but I don’t know her.” Second of all, I didn’t wanna have a baby with her. This is kind of vain. She had, like, a crazy tooth. You ever meet somebody that have, like, a crazy tooth? Like way up here. Like it auditioned to be a horn, but didn’t get it. Way up here. Like, they smile and then smile again, and you’re like, “What the fuck? Where’d your grill get a balcony?” Just way up here, hiding in the attic like John Wilkes Tooth, just ready to fuckin’ pop out and murder the president, son. Murder! Murder! And I didn’t want our first baby to have a special tooth sprouting out of his neck or back, little Shark Week-er. Only get himself a job with the carnival, working in a cage at night opening up mail off his sharpened head tooth, doing special shows for businessmen. My boy ain’t workin’ in no cage. So we hooked up and… afterwards we’re just layin’ there, me and her. Two children of the Lord, done ate the apple. I’m kissing her on her neck up in here, where all the sweet is, right here on the sugar shelf. Just rubbing my hand on her like this, just being real natural. Like a gentleman. Like a little husband. Just like a little handicapped fellow petting a scared sheep. You know, just… “You quit shaking, Daisy, that’s just a storm coming, you see. You just keep growing your wool out, my little mitten-maker. You want more Apple Jacks, don’t you? Don’t you want more of daddy’s Apple Jacks, my little lady angel?” Just being real chill with her. And then I said, “Are you on birth control?” She said no, and that’s when I got real nervous. Kind of felt like my heart had to take a shit. And then I was like, “If you had a baby, would you keep it, and would it be okay if I just wrote y’all letters?” ‘Cause women love getting mail. And she goes, “Actually, I can’t conceive.” And that’s when I started running around the room high-fiving shit. Just cheap shit she had on the walls, like pictures of her family at the beach. She’s like, “Calm down, it’s real sad. I’ve had two miscarriages.” And that is very sad. If somebody says that, you’re supposed to hug them or buy them a plant. When you’re a comedian, you don’t think like that. The devil trying to get your brain. You say things you shouldn’t say, ’cause the words go from your brain right out of your mouth, not through your heart first. I was like, “You’ve had two miscarriages? I feel lucky my penis lived after it was in there.” So that’s what I’ve been doing. They’re just jokes, people! It can’t all be funny. It can’t all be funny. And the Jews are clogging up the Internet. That’s all for that. I think it was easier to meet a woman like in the old days. I don’t know how old some of you are, but maybe the 1800s or whatever. Back then, you just walked out of your house, if you were a man, hundreds of miles if you had to, till you saw any woman, and you just started walking back with her. She’s like, “Where are we going?” You’re like, “To the rest of your life.” And that was a relationship. And if she got out of line, you took her on a warning hike. And I’m not saying it was perfect, I’m just saying that it worked. And the man went out and did the world work. The woman stayed at home and took care of family work. I don’t think it was ideal for anybody, but the kids were fat, the cat was fed. You got home, your wife was there with the mail, like, “Tell me what the mail says!” And I’m not saying it was perfect. I’m just saying that it worked. And then women started wanting to do everything. “We wanna chew gum, we wanna wear hats, we wanna drive big rigs, we wanna CrossFit.” “CrossFittin’? What the fuck are y’all doing? Y’all are doing chin-ups in an abandoned shed all morning? We’re fucking starving at the house. Our boy can’t read. And you’re worried about muscle density? When I married you, you had an ass. Now you got glutes? What are glutes? Don’t make that thing any harder for daddy to get into.” And now they have a hundred machines at the gym for women. And now y’all probably feel obligated to use them all. When I was young, they had four machines at the gym for',\n",
              "  'ladies, and three of them were stoves. “I’m gonna do chest and tris. Why don’t you do that manicotti we love?” And I’m not saying it was perfect. I’m saying that it worked. Here’s what I really believe, ladies. A lot of relationships don’t work anymore because opposites attract. Ladies feel like they have to do everything. Gotta feel like a ton of pressure. But if y’all are doing all the women’s and men’s stuff, what the fuck are we supposed to do? I have on facial moisturizer right now. I don’t know what’s going on. You got women doin’ dead lifts all day, wondering why they don’t have a boyfriend. ‘Cause you’re it. I don’t wanna hug a woman and come in second! You gotta be the lady. Put down the barbells. Pick up some flowers, look lost. You’ll have a boyfriend in five minutes. We gotta stay in our own lanes. The irony is we have enough in common, ladies. Women are always like, “You men look good into your sixties. We start falling apart in our thirties.” That’s bullshit. That’s bullshit, man. I’m in my 30s. My hip clicks for the first hour of every day. Just… [clicking] For no reason at all, I have a mating call for women with osteoporosis built into my body. Okay? My body used to be separate parts. Remember that, guys? When your shoulder was separate from this, when your ass was separate from whatever that is, when your stomach was separate from your chest. Now it’s like I’m living in a fat-muscle onesie I can’t find the zipper to. “Do you like my arm-leg-backceps?” I got gray hair. Is that scary? Yeah, ladies, that means my head is dying. And the first thousand gray hairs, they don’t grow in cool like part of the hair party, they grow in all fuckin’ crazy and swirly, like they’re on dope. Like they’re crack hairs, like, “Damn, dog, I’ll suck your dick for some shampoo. Just comb me, homie.” My nuts look different. I used to have beautiful nuts. If I had my old nuts, I’d bring them right to you, you could pass ’em to your friend and get a look, get a snap with your phone. They was gorgeous. Beautiful little nuts. Looked like the Lord had one Christmas ornament, just hung it on my “D” branch, and went back to the Lord castle. And they were concise nuts. One had a good idea and was telling the other. The other one loved his buddy’s idea, and they was hugging and listening to Cat Stevens. And they were naturally-tanned nuts. And I never took my nuts in the sun ’cause I’m with Christ, I don’t do that kind of shit. Naturally tanned, like angels came at night and just painted my nuts with tanned paint, like the Sistine Nutsack. Now, my nuts look like somebody else been using ’em when I’m not around. Like I got timeshare nuts. Like, “Who didn’t take care of these? I bet it was the Thompsons, check the log!” We’re falling apart too, ladies. I gotta pinch my penis when I fart so it doesn’t drip a little. And that ain’t a disease I have, that’s every man in here over the age of thirty. When you see your husband in the hallway like this, you’re like, “Are you having a stroke?” He’s like, “I’m trying to fart!” We’re falling apart too, man. I shit myself last year. I’ll tell you about it, bro. I ain’t above nothing. I shit myself last year. I was driving my car, and I wasn’t driving to a fancy, shit-yourself meet-up group. I was just driving, and I reached to put the window down, and I don’t know what button I hit, but I shit myself. ‘Cause you can’t trust a fart after 29, that’s why. I used to be young and fart with both my eyes open like a ass gangster. [Blowing air] Now, I gotta keep one eye closed. Keeping watch on the inside. ‘Cause you will shit your sweet Christian self. I look more forward to the fart after sex than I do to sex itself. I was dating this gal for a while, and she had a little cat, would be always in the kitchen waiting for free meats and shit. Little Democat. And I’d be back in the room, just going at it, like two trains trying to pass each other on the same track, but the whole time I’m thinking, “When I get done, I’m-a go in the kitchen and fart on that cat. That’s the pussy that’s really gonna get it here tonight. That little asshole.” We’re falling apart too, ladies. Put down the dumbbells. Pick up some flowers, look lost. It’ll all work out. ‘Cause I think I want to have a child. You got any child? What you got? [Man] A little girl, and one in the oven. You got one in the oven, huh? Hell, yeah, boy, get in there. I’m thinking of having a child. I gotta get a girlfriend first, but… I think I want a child. I just want something to be at home when I’m not there. But a lot of these kids are bitches these days, man, you know? Name seven kids that aren’t bitches, bro. Yeah, nobody can. If they had a tall box right here with a kid in it, I’d be like, “What’s in here? A little bitch, that’s what.” ‘Cause they got it too easy man. These kids have no struggle. We had struggle, these kids have vaccinations. Come on. When I was young, you caught what you caught. Everybody had something. Rubella, lockjaw, we all had a little bit of polio, remember? I had a friend who had a fuckin’ arm growing out of his back, Larry Armback. Got a great job as a crossing guard. He could have been an Olympic swimmer, but he had a skin condition. He was black. So… Oh, whatever, dude. You can put 20',\n",
              "  'arms on a brother, he ain’t gonna wanna get in the deep end. Kids are calling the cops on their parents, man. What? Back in the day if you called the cops on your parents, the cops would get your parents on the phone and tell your parents to beat yo’ ass. My mother used to whoop my ass. I didn’t think she lived with us. She whooped me so bad one time, I couldn’t put clothes on my skin. My buddy’s like, “You’re naked!” I’m like, “But I’m behavin’! This is my behavior outfit. Now quit lookin’ at my dick.” What if I have a dumb kid? I worry about that. I fucked some dumb girls, man. One of them hatches something, now I got to raise that. I can’t imagine my whole life just hugging some kid, pretending he ain’t dumb, and knowing he’s dumb. Like, “Aw, everything’s gonna be fine, man.” That’s got to be the worst, man. We shouldn’t let dumb people have kids, man. We wouldn’t have that problem. If you don’t graduate high school, you shouldn’t get to have a kid. How you gonna raise a kid? You couldn’t raise a “F” to a “D.” The problem is we circumcise the wrong part of the boy. We keep slipping off the turtleneck, we need to take the nuts. Give ’em back to him when he graduates high school. “Congratulations, ladies and gentlemen, it’s a wonderful day. Ladies, move your tassels from left to the right. Men, you can pick your tassels up from that cardboard box on the way out of the auditorium.” Some of you ladies need to quit having eight kids before we know what your first kid is like. You see a woman got seven kids all under the age of five. Like, “How did you even fuckin’ do that? You ain’t a woman, you a wizard.” From now on, you get one kid. We check on his ass at six. If he ain’t shit, you don’t get any more fuckin’ kids. Why? ‘Cause the first one ain’t shit. Sick of this bullshit in this country, man. Sick of it, bro. We gotta get rid of some people. I don’t know if I want to bring a child into this world. There’s some straight creeps out there, dawg. Some straight lurkers. If you’re over the age of 30 and you still skateboard, who the fuck are you, dude? Not Tony Hawk, that’s who. Jacking up my insurance premiums, sir. Now get the fuck out. If you wear camouflage but you ain’t in the woods or in the military, who you hiding from? From looking decent, that’s who. Operation Desert Dumb Ass. Now put on an acceptable pattern, or get the fuck out. If you wear sunglasses while you work out at the gym, are you serious? You look like a blind person that’s good at shit. Only two men ever looked good in sweat and sunglasses, that’s Fidel Castro and the late Macho Man Randy Savage. So why don’t you snap into a slim piece of advice and get the fuck out? If you sleep with the TV on, and wonder why you have attention deficit disorder. I don’t know, probably because you sleep with the TV on! Shut it off and get some shut-eye or get out. Asian people who are driving, no more driving. I know it’s cliché, but the trial period has to be over, man. They can’t drive, dude. No more driving, okay? I don’t Cirque du Soleil ’cause I can’t Cirque du Soleil. We shouldn’t just be doing shit just because. So park it, Asians, and invent the hoverboard I know you know how to make ’cause I can see it in your eyes… or get the fuck out! Thick people that’s hoggin’ all the wheelchairs at the airport. And I ain’t sayin’ it’s sistas, but I ain’t sayin’ it ain’t. Disabled Staff Sergent So-and-So, who lost his legs in Afghanistan, gotta elbow-crawl to make his connection ’cause Mama Bear is hogging all the assistance. Park it and walk if off, Loqshwanda, or get out. Okay? Persian people. Get out, bro. Nobody likes you guys, man. Sorry to be the messenger. If you guys were offended by anything I said tonight, get the fuck out, son! I’m Theo Von, thank you guys very much for comin’ out tonight. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much.
