It premiered on HBO on April 13, 2013. Filmed in Phoenix, Arizona at the Celebrity Theatre\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIntro\\nFade the music out. Let’s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all.\\n“The Old Lady And The Dog”\\nI live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n“My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”\\n“The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n“Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.\\n“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”\\n“Putting On Socks”\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n“If You’re Older You’re Smarter”\\nI don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n“Getting Older Makes My Life Better”\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n“Everybody Has Their Time”\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”\\n“Dating Takes Courage”\\nIt’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.”\\n“First Date”\\nI always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there.\\n“Tits”\\nGuys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!”\\n“Divorce”\\nI’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad.\\n“Videoing Your Kids”\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!”\\n“Life Is A Good Deal”\\nDon’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it ending.\\n“Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.\\n“If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n“Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

It premiered on HBO on April 13, 2013. Filmed in Phoenix, Arizona at the Celebrity Theatre\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nIntro\\nFade the music out. Let’s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all.\\n“The Old Lady And The Dog”\\nI live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n“My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”\\n“The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n“Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a fountain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.\\n“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”\\n“Putting On Socks”\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n“If You’re Older You’re Smarter”\\nI don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n“Getting Older Makes My Life Better”\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n“Everybody Has Their Time”\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”\\n“Dating Takes Courage”\\nIt’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.”\\n“First Date”\\nI always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there.\\n“Tits”\\nGuys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!”\\n“Divorce”\\nI’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad.\\n“Videoing Your Kids”\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!”\\n“Life Is A Good Deal”\\nDon’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it ending.\\n“Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.\\n“If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n“Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, we’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d\\n\\u266a A whole new world \\u266a\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore.\\nI\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d\\nI can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

From recounting his experiences with fame and evolving societal norms to navigating personal milestones like his relationships and the challenges of maintaining his authenticity, Iglesias crafts a deeply engaging narrative. The special reflects his belief in staying true to his comedic roots\\u2014focusing on entertainment without alienation\\u2014while touching on personal growth, his rise to international fame, and the enduring loyalty of his fans. Through hilarious retellings of real-life situations, including a robbery, his missteps in cultural sensitivity, and navigating life post-breakup, Iglesias showcases his ability to laugh at himself and find humor even in adversity. The show is a testament to his longevity, adaptability, and connection with audiences, offering both laughs and introspection.\\n* * *\\n[crowd cheering]\\n[crowd chanting]\\nFluffy!\\n[cheering stops]\\n[Gabriel] Man, look at this crowd.

Also, I would like to thank, since we\\u2019re here, Only in Dade. Thank you so much. If you know, you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] \\u2026and I think you know. [crowd chuckles] And also, to my friends over at La Carreta for all the food. So\\u2026\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYes. [laughing] Yeah, man. Before we get started, you guys, uh, I would like to thank the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino for the opportunity to record a special. No other entertainer has done a special here yet. Tonight is the first one.\\n[crowd cheering]\\nIt wasn\\u2019t the Rolling Stones. It wasn\\u2019t the Eagles. They trusted a comedian\\u2026 [crowd cheers] \\u2026to make this happen. So I wanna say thank you. Is anybody else staying here at the, uh\\u2026 at the Hard Rock? [crowd cheers] Hey, me too.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a beautiful hotel, and I\\u2019m not just saying that \\u2019cause my room is free. [audience laughs] You know you\\u2019re in a nice hotel and casino when you turn on your TV in your room and they have their own video. Like, if you\\u2019re staying here, you turn on the TV, you get this, [trills tongue] [feminine voice] \\u201cWelcome to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [moans seductively] \\u201cTwenty-four-hour gambling, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\\u201d [moans suggestively] I\\u2019m sitting there like, \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t I stop watching this?\\u201d And I started thinking, at this point, why don\\u2019t they just do that to the slot machines? You know? Gambling\\u2019s already shameless. Might as well go all the way. You walk up to one of the little machines, pop in a 20. [whirring] [moans loudly] [whirring, moans] [feminine voice] \\u201cDon\\u2019t stop.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [audience laughs] People are walking by. \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cTrying to get the jackpot!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] Yeah, man. I\\u2019m gonna start the show off tonight with a question. That\\u2019s not how comedy shows happen, but I\\u2019m gonna start it with a question. The question is, who here tonight has never heard of me up until tonight? [scattered cheering] Five. Two. Five. Okay. To those of you, the five of you, I say, \\u201cSorry.\\u201d I know you got excited. You saw the ticket. You saw the last name, and then I walked out. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cEnrique got bigger.\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why I ask who has never seen or heard of me before is because if you have, then you know the type of show that I do. And you know the type of show that I don\\u2019t do. Like, I\\u2019m not here to tell you who to vote for, who not to vote for, what shot to take or what baby to get rid of. That\\u2019s not for me to say. If you\\u2019re already offended, you missed the point. I\\u2019m telling you what I\\u2019m not gonna do. I promise you, I am here to entertain, not offend. Okay? [audience cheers] We\\u2019re gonna have fun with everybody. Starting with me, but I\\u2019m gonna let you know, we\\u2019re living in a different time. I\\u2019ve been doing this so long, I always figured, as long as I\\u2019m being nice, I shouldn\\u2019t have any issues, but it\\u2019s a very different time. This is year 27 for me.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYeah. Twenty-seven years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I never had to worry. You know, when I first got started, shoot\\u2026 1997, I was clean-shaven, I had hair. I know. Look at some of you. \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d Huh? Vaccine. I know. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kid\\u2026 I\\u2019m kidding. Sorry, Florida. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kidding. I said \\u201cVaccine,\\u201d some of you were like, \\u201cI told you!\\u201d Yeah. [crowd laughs] [in Spanish] \\u201cI told you. He said so.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [in English] Some friends tell me, \\u201cDude, man, you\\u2019re making money now. Why don\\u2019t you get the hair thingy?\\u201d I said, \\u201cFor what?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, some women, they want a guy with hair.\\u201d Well, good for them.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd they\\u2019re not lying. I have gone out with some women that made it a point to tell me that hair was important. One told me flat out, \\u201cI need to be able to run my fingers through your hair.\\u201d Yeah! And I told her, \\u201cHey, look, if you go deep enough\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026you\\u2019re gonna get your wish.\\u201d \\u201cYou were not specific on location. Hey.\\u201d \\u201cYou want hair, you want pelos, I got you.\\u201d But, yeah, 27 years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I have seen a lot of comedians come and go. And I feel very grateful that in all that time, we\\u2019ve still managed to maintain a certain level.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo I feel like we\\u2019re doing something right. Which feels weird to me, because now I feel like you gotta be very mindful. Okay? You gotta be extra mindful. Like\\u2026 Uh, 27 years of being a comedian, I finally started hearing people tell me things that I\\u2019ve never heard before. I started hearing people tell me things like, \\u201cHey, Fluffy. I grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience chuckles] Which is an incredible compliment because that doesn\\u2019t just say that you\\u2019re a fan, that says that you\\u2019re invested. That says that you\\u2019ve been following this career for a very long time. Some of you, the first time you saw me perform, you were kids. [audience cheers] And now some of you are here tonight with your kids. [audience cheers] And so, I just want to say thank you for all those years of trust and continuing to come back to see the show. It means a lot. [audience cheers and applauds] Hearing someone say they grew up watching me, that is one of the most beautiful compliments any entertainer can receive. And I understand that now, with therapy, that that\\u2019s what that means.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nLook, I\\u2019m not gonna lie. The first time I heard someone tell me that they grew up watching me, I didn\\u2019t know how to handle it. I didn\\u2019t know how to process because nobody wants to feel like they\\u2019re getting\\u2026 old. The first time I heard it, I was like\\u2026 [gasps dramatically] Second time I heard it, I was like, \\u201cBuy a hat.\\u201d The third time, I accepted it. I was like, [as old white man\\u2019] \\u201cMany years ago, when I first got started, all of this was land as far as the eye could see.\\u201d \\u201cIt was a very different time, and\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I don\\u2019t know why my old voice is white. [audience laughs] He just is. I tried doing the Mexican voice, but you don\\u2019t take him as serious. [in Spanish] \\u201cWell, screw you.\\u201d \\u201cWe were at the ranch, and were told to fuck off, dude.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s very tough out there.\\u201d [in English] But times are changing. The rules are changing. So I don\\u2019t know how much longer this is gonna be okay. I\\u2019ll tell you what happened to me and why I brought that up. I did a podcast. And before I went into the studio, I\\u2019m talking to the producer outside. And the producer\\u2019s excited and happy, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGabriel Iglesias, we\\u2019re so excited to have you.\\u201d \\u201cThis is really cool.\\u201d \\u201cBefore you go in, the host wanted me to ask you something before you go in for your interview.\\u201d I go, \\u201cSure, go for it.\\u201d \\u201cOkay. What do you identify as?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I wasn\\u2019t sure how to answer that. I\\u2019m 47 years old. I didn\\u2019t know what to say. I was like, \\u201cShit. Hungry, I guess.\\u201d\\nI mean\\u2026\\n[audience laughs] I\\u2019m tired, sleepy, depressed on Tuesdays. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to say. See, here\\u2019s the thing. I knew what she was trying to ask me. I just wasn\\u2019t trying to get involved in a conversation about something that has absolutely nothing to do with me. This was\\u2026 Yeah. [audience cheers] I felt like I was being baited because no matter how I answered that question, I was gonna find myself in an awkward situation. So you know, because for me, I was just like, \\u201cLet me just be funny.\\u201d But nowadays, you can\\u2019t just not answer the question because silence is seen as a problem. And I\\u2019m sorry if me not answering a certain question is considered a problem. I was brought up during a time where you were constantly told to mind your business.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s all I\\u2019m trying to do is stay in my lane. Another thing we were constantly told was always respect your elders. [audience cheers] And no matter what generation you were from, that was at least the one thing we could always agree on until now. Now older people are seen as a problem. They are. You know, and I understand the youth of today has the technology in the palm of their hands, and you can google just about anything, but you cannot google life experience. Okay? You can\\u2019t. You can\\u2019t download struggling. You can\\u2019t download failure. You can\\u2019t download these moments that help build you up to make you a better person. And so again, for me, I chose to stay in my lane and just crack jokes when the girl asked me the question. She got very upset. She got very offended. As soon as I cracked the joke, she was like, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not what I mean.\\u201d \\u201cI mean what are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cFor example, are you a they or them?\\u201d \\u201cA they\\u201d? [audience chuckles] \\u201cOr a them\\u201d? [audience laughs] \\u201cHow fat am I?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhen did I stop being an it?\\u201d Apparently, I ate myself into a plural. That\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience chuckles and applauds]\\nWhat I\\u2019m finding is, even if you have good intentions, and you\\u2019re trying to be cool, you can still find yourself in a situation. So, I\\u2019ll tell you what else happened to me, m\\u2019kay? I was at a McDonald\\u2019s. [audience chuckles] That\\u2019s not even the joke, but okay. [audience laughs] All righty. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHere, this is gonna be good.\\u201d No, no! I was at a McDonald\\u2019s by my house. The McDonald\\u2019s by my house is actually a twofer. It\\u2019s a McDonald\\u2019s on the corner, and it\\u2019s also a gas station. I got a big SUV. I knew it was gonna be a minute. So I said, \\u201cLet me go get some nuggets while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I walk into the McDonald\\u2019s, and as I\\u2019m walking in, I couldn\\u2019t help but notice this homeless family sitting right outside. Now, they didn\\u2019t have a sign. They did not ask me for money, but you could just tell. You could just tell that this poor family is dealing with life. So I get inside, and I said, \\u201cYou know what?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t need anything to eat.\\u201d \\u201cI really don\\u2019t. At this point, it\\u2019s just the habit.\\u201d [audience laughs] I get to the register, and I say, \\u201cYou know what? Let me order some food for the family.\\u201d \\u201cThey got kids with them.\\u201d So I placed an order and the cashier\\u2019s like, \\u201cAnything else?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes. Do you have, um\\u2026 um, Wet-Naps?\\u201d \\u201cExcuse me?\\u201d \\u201cYou know, Wet-Naps to clean your hands.\\u201d \\u201cSir, you\\u2019re more than welcome to use the restroom.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll give you the code.\\u201d \\u201cHere\\u2019s the thing.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s not for me. It\\u2019s for the homeless family that\\u2019s right outside the door.\\u201d \\u201cI want to make sure that the little kids can clean their hands before they eat.\\u201d \\u201cThis food that I just ordered is for them.\\u201d And as we\\u2019re talking\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you. As we\\u2019re talking, the manager at the McDonald\\u2019s is listening in to our conversation. And she walks over. And she\\u2019s all nosy, right? She\\u2019s like, \\u201cExcuse me. I couldn\\u2019t help but overhear.\\u201d \\u201cDid you just say that this food is for the family outside?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I hope that\\u2019s okay.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, it is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cGiving food to people who need food is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cHowever, what you just called them is not okay.\\u201d [audience groans] [as self] \\u201cWhat did I call them?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cYou said\\u2026 homeless.\\u201d [as self] \\u201c\\u2018Cause they are! Look. Shit.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cHe\\u2019s lickin\\u2019 the window!\\u201d [audience laughs] [as manager] \\u201cYou can\\u2019t say that word. It\\u2019s considered offensive.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWho complained?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, well, if I\\u2019m not supposed to say the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019 anymore, what am I supposed to say instead of the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cThe new politically correct term is actually \\u2018unhoused\\u2019 when describing someone in an unfortunate situation like that.\\u201d [audience jeering] [as self] \\u201cYou\\u2019re kidding.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, sir. I\\u2019m not kidding. And please lower your voice.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYou want me to lower my voice when you\\u2019re saying something so ridiculous?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cIf you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly, you are part of the problem, not the solution.\\u201d [audience chuckling] Oh, Miami. I wanted to get ghetto. [audience cheers] I wanted to get ghetto. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I wanted to go full Hialeah on them. [audience cheering] [man] Love you, Fluffy! Thank you for coming, Hialeah. [audience cheers] So yeah, I wanted to go off on her, but I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I wanted to get ghetto, but I couldn\\u2019t because that is the regular McDonald\\u2019s I go to.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nYou know what I\\u2019m saying? I\\u2019m not trying to get banned. The next one\\u2019s far, and gas is a bitch, so I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNah.\\u201d So I looked at her, and I said, \\u201cOkay. We\\u2019re gonna play this game?\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s play this game.\\u201d \\u201cFrom now on, I\\u2019m no longer fat.\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201cAccording to you, I am now \\u2018unexercised.'\\u201d [audience laughs] [audience cheering] I did, bro. She looked at me, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t be ridiculous.\\u201d And I looked at her, and I was like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d \\u201cOh, well, if you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly you are part of the problem.\\u201d \\u201cNot the solution.\\u201d [audience cheers] And I grabbed the food, and I walked out. Now, second half of the story. I walk over to the family. M\\u2019kay? And I hand the bags of food to the mom. And the mom was so nice. She was just happy that someone thought of her and her kids. She got very emotional. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI just want to say thank you.\\u201d \\u201cYou have no idea what you\\u2019re doing for us right now.\\u201d \\u201cThis really means a lot.\\u201d \\u201cThank you.\\u201d And I had to ask the question. [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I know what you thought. Some of you are like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it.\\u201d Oh, I did it. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. Watch. So, I looked, and I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d And she was like, \\u201cNo, unfortunately. We\\u2019re not okay. We\\u2019re not.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been homeless now for four days.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you heard.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cBut, uh\\u2026\\u201d No, not\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience chuckles] I didn\\u2019t correct her \\u2019cause I\\u2019m not a dick. That\\u2019s why I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience laughs] That\\u2019s what I mean, you guys. Even if you have good intentions nowadays, people can take what you\\u2019re saying or doing and twist it to make you look bad. There should be no consequences for being kind, for trying to help, for wanting to do the right thing, for caring. Unfortunately, we\\u2019re still consumed by this word called \\u201cliability\\u201d that sometimes we forget to be a little human, and that\\u2019s unfortunate. I\\u2019m not trying to get on a soapbox about this. I\\u2019m trying to let you know some things I\\u2019ve been dealing with, and I\\u2019m just here to report. [audience chuckles] The thing with me now is that after 27 years of being a comedian, every time I walk out the door, the light is officially on. In the sense that every time I leave my house, there is a slight chance I could make the news. For example, did Martin talk about how, uh, he fell off the stage earlier in the show?\\n[crowd] Yeah.\\nOkay. Okay, cool. Uh, for the home audience, Martin, he fell a while back. He talked about it. I know you didn\\u2019t see it, \\u2019cause your subscription only covers so much.\\nUm, yeah.\\n[audience laughs] You can watch the first half on Prime. I think it\\u2019s on Prime. Maybe you can just see it there then come back and check out the rest. So, long story short, we were doing a show in Phoenix, Arizona, and Martin accidentally fell off of a stage this high, and he broke his foot. Now, the incredible part about Martin is that he got up, and on adrenaline, ran around, got back up on stage, and performed. And then was taken to the hospital after he walked off stage. He is a professional. [audience cheers] Seriously, that is a pro. Much respect \\u2019cause if it would have been me\\u2026 [audience chuckles] If I would\\u2019ve fallen off stage, and the staff was like, \\u201cWhat about the fans?\\u201d \\u201cWell, bye, Felicia.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhat do we tell \\u2019em?\\u201d \\u201cRefund.\\u201d [audience laughs] But see, the difference is Martin had to tell you he fell for you to know he fell. And by the way, I saw the fall. I saw. He came out and just kind of tripped over a cord backstage, came through the curtain already, you know. And then, you know\\u2026 \\u201cMartiiin!\\u201d [imitates thud] Women in the front row were like, \\u201cHe fell for me.\\u201d [audience laughs] I\\u2019m glad you laughed. I said that last night and some guy was like, \\u201cAw.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cWhy \\u2018aww\\u2019?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s your friend.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cExactly. That\\u2019s why I make fun of him.\\u201d That is the mark of a true friendship, is being able to say real evil things about each other. [audience cheers] Because you know you don\\u2019t really mean it. Plus, you don\\u2019t think that if I would\\u2019ve fallen off the stage instead of Martin that he wouldn\\u2019t\\u2019ve had a joke? You better believe he would have had a joke. He would have told people, \\u201cI saw Fluffy bounce.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot to mention the fact that you know that\\u2019ll make the news. I fall off the stage tonight, there\\u2019ll be a van out in front in an hour. \\u201cWe\\u2019re standing here live in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, where authorities believe Fluffy lost control.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to Tom, who\\u2019s inside the venue who can fill us in with more.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, Jim, I\\u2019m standing here at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, inside the venue where apparently Fluffy took a spill.\\u201d \\u201cIt is still uncertain as to what happened here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cWe did have a chance to interview local authorities who had this to say.\\u201d \\u201cDamn!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt is still uncertain if there was any problems with the stage.\\u201d \\u201cWe did speak to security who had this to comment.\\u201d \\u201cI saw the whole damn thing. Okay?\\u201d \\u201cWhoo! Fluffy fell. He fell hard.\\u201d \\u201cI ain\\u2019t seen that many white people cry since a Taylor Swift concert.\\u201d \\u201cIt was bad. It was bad. And in Miami. Are you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cHe hurt more Cubans than Castro.\\u201d [audience laughs] And that\\u2019s how you get canceled. So, uh, that\\u2019s the point I\\u2019m trying to make here. I made the news recently. Uh, without giving too much away, there\\u2019s an episode of Family Feud coming out very soon that I\\u2019m gonna be on. Yeah.\\n[audience applauds]\\nIt is the celebrity edition, so it\\u2019s Fluffy and Fluffy\\u2019s family versus Fat Joe\\u2026 [audience gasps] \\u2026and his family. So yeah, it\\u2019s Fat Joe versus Fluffy because apparently, the producers have a great sense of humor. [audience laughs] Long story short, I flew in some family from the East Coast to be on the show. The show went over very well. You\\u2019ll find out who wins later. Here\\u2019s the deal. The next day, my sister, who was one of the people I flew in, she hadn\\u2019t been in California in forever, and she was like, \\u201cCan we go to Disneyland?\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cSure, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d So it was her and her husband Gordy, and I took them to Disney. And we get on a couple of rides, and just so we\\u2019re clear, that\\u2019s not what made the news. [audience chuckles] I said that last night, someone was like, \\u201c\\u2018Cause he fit.\\u201d No!\\n[audience laughs]\\nSome people. Right? Yeah. We get on the Cars ride at California Adventure, and halfway through the Cars ride, the car\\u2026 [imitates engine revving, brakes screeching] \\u2026stops on the track. And my sister looked at me. She goes, \\u201cIs this supposed to happen?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, the check cleared. We\\u2019re supposed to finish. This is, uh\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWe paid. It\\u2019s supposed to work. No, this\\u2026\\u201d It took the Disney people about 20 minutes to come get us and take us out of the car. So we\\u2019re sitting there, outside, in the sun for 20 minutes. I had no problem with that because I am mocha. I\\u2019m okay in the sun for 20 minutes. My sister, she\\u2019s twice as dark as me. She\\u2019s, like, freaking, you know, Apache. She\\u2019s\\u2026 You know. Freaking Azteca. [chanting] Just, you know\\u2026 Her husband, on the other hand, he\\u2019s from Minnesota. [audience laughs] He almost died.\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cOh, don\\u2019 cha know?\\u201d Yeah, so\\u2026 while we\\u2019re sitting there in the car, waiting for the Disney people to come take us out of the car, the people waiting in line realize that the ride has been shut down. And so from the ride, you can see the line. People see the car on the track, and then they see who\\u2019s in the car. [audience chuckles] And all of a sudden, cell phones start comin\\u2019 out. And by the time we left Disney, TMZ had already reported the story, and you can google this, okay? TMZ reported the story. Before we left the park, it said, \\u201cFluffy Stuck on LA Freeway at Disney.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I thought it was cute. I thought it was silly. I thought it was funny. I thought it was okay. Until I read the comments. [audience chuckles] Oh, some of you\\u2026 are dicks. [audience laughs] One lady wrote, \\u201cJust \\u2019cause you\\u2019re tall enough to ride doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re small enough to fit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nA guy wrote, \\u201cThe car got tired.\\u201d [audience laughs] Another guy wrote, \\u201cYou\\u2019re Mexican. Couldn\\u2019t you fix it?\\u201d [audience laughs] And that was Martin, yeah. So\\u2026 [audience laughs] [imitates rim shot] Anyway, so\\u2026 The time before that, we made world news. Some of you might remember this story. The guys and I were involved in an emergency landing situation. I had, uh, chartered a private jet because my last Netflix special, the money finally hit my account, and I, you know, freakin\\u2019\\u2026 I thought I was, y\\u2019know, ballin\\u2019, right? Nope. Turns out we were fallin\\u2019! Worst turbulence we have ever experienced in 27 years of being comedians. Uh, worst turbulence I ever felt, for sure. At one point, the jet did this.\\n[whooshes]\\n[audience chuckles] I did this.\\n[imitates thud]\\n[audience chuckles] The scariest part was watching my dogs leave the seat. Fortunately, we landed safely. We were okay. That\\u2019s not what made the news. What made the news is that, when we came in for the landing, the jet touched down, and then it skid off the runway by 200 yards, and we ended up in a field. A field. A field! Are you kidding me? As hard as I work\\u2026 [audience laughs] [audience applauds] \\u2026to break stereotypes. [audience laughs] A bunch of Mexicans ended up in a field. Yeah, that\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat\\u2019s how TMZ reported it. \\u201cMexicans Found in Field.\\u201d [audience chuckles] In the movies, the pilots are always the first to know when there\\u2019s an issue. And in the movies, the pilots always have the courtesy of telling the passengers. They love to hear themselves talk. They get on the mic, \\u201cAll right. It\\u2019s your captain speaking here.\\u201d \\u201cI just want to let you know we\\u2019ll be experiencing rough air.\\u201d \\u201cIf you could just fasten your seatbelts, we\\u2019re gonna be A-okay. All right\\u2026\\u201d [murmurs] You know? If it gets bumpy, you know, [whooshing] [as captain, mumbling] \\u201cIt\\u2019s your captain speaking.\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just had a little Mexican food here, so we\\u2026 we\\u2019re feeling a little bumpy up here.\\u201d \\u201cWe just had some fast food.\\u201d \\u201cJust a reminder to keep your seat belts fastened.\\u201d \\u201cWe might be getting a bit\\u2026 There we go. Just a bit there.\\u201d [laughs] \\u201cAll right, I\\u2019ll be back with you in just a few seconds\\u2026\\u201d [mumbles indistinctly] If the plane\\u2019s going down, \\u201cBrace for impact!\\u201d \\u201cHold on tight! We\\u2019re comin\\u2019 in hot!\\u201d Our pilot\\u2026 nada.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOur pilot didn\\u2019t say anything until we came to, like, a complete stop. And then maybe like a minute later, the cockpit door opened up, and he stuck his head in, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou good?\\u201d [audience laughs] I was like, \\u201cMy chihuahua\\u2019s in a cup holder. I am not good.\\u201d It was a scary situation, you guys, but let me tell you, even though we were involved in an emergency landing and we thought we were gonna die, I\\u2019m grateful for the experience. Believe it or not. I\\u2019m grateful because it reminded me how valuable life is and how quickly things can change.\\n[audience applauds]\\nEvery now and then, we need a little reminder. We need to get shaken up a little to remind ourselves, \\u201cOh my God. This is special.\\u201d \\u201cThis is important. Enjoy it. Have fun.\\u201d The rest of the day after the landing, there was nothing anybody could tell me to ruin how good I felt to just be breathing and be alive. Nothing! [audience cheers and applauds] And so, that\\u2019s why I, uh\\u2026 I\\u2019m grateful for bad moments. And I think bad moments are actually a good thing because we need balance in life. You need to have bad experiences in order to truly appreciate good experiences. Not every day can be the same. [audience applauds] You need to have a way to ba\\u2013 Now, don\\u2019t get me wrong. Sometimes there\\u2019s too many bad days in a row. That shit sucks. And that\\u2019s actually what happened to me. After the near-death experience, I go home. I go home to find out that someone broke into my house. [audience gasps] Yeah. Yeah, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I survived? To see this shit?\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why you haven\\u2019t heard about it until now is because the detective who\\u2019s working the case told me I\\u2019m not allowed to talk about it. In California.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah, if the guys that broke into my house are here tonight\\u2026 [scoffs] \\u2026bravo. [sarcastically] Bravo. That\\u2019s a flex and a half. No, they broke into my house, and of course, the number one question is, \\u201cWhat did they take from your house?\\u201d And what they took from me, honestly, it was my peace of mind. I didn\\u2019t feel safe in that house after. Uh, but if you must know, I did everything to prevent a break-in. I had, first of all, a good neighborhood. I had an alarm. I had two camera systems. I had a fence that surrounded the property. I thought I was good. Um, I got video footage of the entire robbery.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIn 4K. [audience chuckles] Oh, that shit is crisp. I saw the guys that broke in, but I could not identify them because they were wearing masks. All I can tell you about the two guys that broke into my house is that they were 20 years old. I know they were 20 because when they jumped the fence and hit the ground, no pain.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf that would\\u2019ve been a 35-year-old with messed-up sciatica, he\\u2019d have thought twice about that fence. So, they jumped the fence, went in the backyard, and they broke the window and got in through the kitchen. They trashed my house. Okay, every drawer, open. Every cabinet, open. Everything got pulled out onto the floor so they could sift. Uh\\u2026 Couches were flipped over, cushions were thrown down, and they pulled every single frame off the wall. And I asked the detective, I said, \\u201cHey, look. I understand the drawers, the cabinets, and even the couch thing.\\u201d \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the story with the frames on the wall?\\u201d \\u201cWhy did they take everything off the wall but didn\\u2019t take any frames?\\u201d \\u201cSome of that stuff was art.\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cMr. Iglesias, you have to understand something about these people that broke into your home.\\u201d \\u201cThey were not looking for photos or art.\\u201d \\u201cThey were actually looking for a safe.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cYes, sir. A safe.\\u201d \\u201cA lot of times, in these homes, people will put a hole in the wall, install a safe, and then they\\u2019ll hang a frame over the safe to disguise that their valuables are in there.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d\\n[audience chuckles]\\n[as cop] \\u201cSir, yes, a safe.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cBut I just got this money.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cDid they check the mattress?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as cop] \\u201cDon\\u2019t know.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s find out!\\u201d So, we walk into the master bedroom. I grab the edge of the bed, right? And I picked it up, and I was like, \\u201cAh, stupid!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all here.\\u201d Oh my God. These guys had no idea they were robbing somebody more ghetto than them. [audience laughs] So, at the end of it, they only got a couple of little trinkets from the drawers. Um, and that\\u2019s pretty much it. They made a mess of the house. They didn\\u2019t get any of the money. I\\u2019ll tell you what they did get. They got my guns. [audience exclaims] Now\\u2026 I have never been open about the fact that I am, in fact, a registered gun owner.\\n[audience cheers]\\nRelax, Florida. [audience laughs] I\\u2019ve never been open about it because, quite frankly, it\\u2019s nobody\\u2019s business. Okay? However, it does pertain to the story that I\\u2019m about to share with you. Um, I am a recent gun owner. I became a gun owner in 2020, m\\u2019kay? Uh, yeah, when we were in the middle of\\u2026 [loudly] \\u2026it. [audience laughs] Every morning watching the news, we didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen, and it started to feel irresponsible, not preparing myself for a worst-case situation. Every morning watching the news, it felt like we were headed towards the Purge. [audience chuckles] Some of you are laughing, but think about this, the Purge would have taken less time. [audience chuckles] Yeah, the Purge. That\\u2019s how they should\\u2019ve woke us up, at least for entertainment purposes. [imitates alarm sounding] [feminine voice] \\u201cI\\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in the pandemic.\\u201d \\u201cThe local time is 7:45 a.m.\\u201d [moans seductively]\\n[audience laughs]\\nFear is why I decided to buy a gun. I was afraid, and I got no problem saying that. I was scared. We didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen. Um, it\\u2019s only for protection. I don\\u2019t hunt. I don\\u2019t want to hunt. I don\\u2019t need to. I know where there\\u2019s three Chick-fil-As. [audience laughs] I\\u2019m good. I don\\u2019t go out on the weekends, you know? Pull! [imitates rifle firing] There\\u2019s no\\u2026 [quacking] I still own a Nintendo. I don\\u2019t need that shit. Fear is the only reason why I decided to buy a gun. So, I wound up at this sporting goods store right by my house. I walk in there, and this place is packed full of people that normally would not have been open to the idea of owning a gun, but they felt like me. They were scared, and rightfully so. I kept hearing the same conversation over and over and over. I kept hearing this\\u2026 \\u201cI would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it.\\u201d [audience cheers] [audience applauds] And I don\\u2019t care where you\\u2019re from, that makes a lot of sense. And I was not about to let politics interfere with my personal safety. So, next thing you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] So, next thing you know, I got in line. I had to get a ticket with a number like when you\\u2019re at the DMV or meat market. [in Spanish] The butcher shop. The bodega. \\u201cNumber five!\\u201d [in English] I got in line. Forty-five minutes, I waited in line. And as soon as I get to the front, this guy comes to the counter, and he\\u2019s like\\u2026 [in Southern accent] \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, um\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I heard some of you chuckle, and just so we\\u2019re clear, I\\u2019m not saying that\\u2026 all people [sighs] \\u2026who sell guns\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u2026talk like that. [audience laughs] But his name was Jim. [audience laughs] So, Jim was like, \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m here to see about purchasing my first firearm.\\u201d \\u201cWell, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Know what you want?\\u201d \\u201cOr you need a hand?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019ve had some time to look at your selection, and I think I found something that\\u2019s gonna work for me.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. Show me what you got.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, right over here in the case.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, right here.\\u201d \\u201cThis one. The one right here, in the front.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. Not that one. This one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. This one. Not that one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. The one in front.\\u201d \\u201cWith the tag. The tag. Right here. The one that says two-two.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cUm, sir, did you just call that gun\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cYeah. What?\\u201d \\u201cJi\\u2026 Jim, right? Jim? Jim.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at me like I\\u2019m crazy, dude. I\\u2019m just reading the tag.\\u201d \\u201cIt says it right here. In the front. It says two-two.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou mean a .22?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, yeah. I guess. Two-two, .22, same thing.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, I hate to break it to you, but there\\u2019s a big difference between a tutu and a .22.\\u201d \\u201cBut hey, this is California, so whatever floats your boat, son.\\u201d \\u201cAll right?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cNow, is there any particular reason why you have selected a, uh\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cWell, um, as impressive as your selection of guns here is, I recognize a lot of them from movies.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s a bit much for me.\\u201d \\u201cUm, I\\u2019m very simple.\\u201d \\u201cUm, this gun looks very manageable.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s small and, you know, it looks easy.\\u201d \\u201cPlus, it\\u2019s on sale.\\u201d \\u201cYou know what I mean? Come on, man. A gun\\u2019s a gun, right?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as Jim] \\u201cNot exactly.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIs this not a good choice?\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, you want my opinion, or you want to buy and be done with it?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNo, please tell me if I\\u2019m making a mistake.\\u201d \\u201cIs\\u2026 is a\\u2026 a .22 a good gun or a bad gun?\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, in my personal opinion, you\\u2019re better off tickling him, as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cAll you\\u2019re gonna do is aggravate the situation.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re just gonna piss him off is what I\\u2019m trying to tell you.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, listen to my thought process.\\u201d \\u201cMy whole idea for the gun is, I\\u2019m gonna use the gun more so like as a deterrent.\\u201d \\u201cSo if somebody breaks into the house, they\\u2019re gonna see this big bald Mexican holding a gun, and then they\\u2019re gonna think twice and then rob my neighbors instead.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, if somebody breaks into your house and they have a gun, they\\u2019re gonna know you\\u2019re holding a .22.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s gon\\u2019 happen. They\\u2019re gon\\u2019 take it from ya.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cAnd they\\u2019re gonna beat the holy hell outta you with it. Right?\\u201d \\u201cAnd the beating you\\u2019re gon\\u2019 get from a .22 is gonna hurt a hell of a lot more than the bullets out of a .22.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s for damn sure.\\u201d [audience applauds] \\u201cNow, listen, I don\\u2019t know you, but I think I know your situation.\\u201d \\u201cAnd correct me if I\\u2019m wrong.\\u201d \\u201cYou want to protect your home?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYour family?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYour valuables?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right, follow me.\\u201d \\u201cI think I got just what you need right here.\\u201d \\u201cM\\u2019kay?\\u201d \\u201cYou see this right here? This here\\u2019s a 9 millimeter to start.\\u201d\\n[crowd cheers]\\n\\u201cOkay?\\u201d \\u201cA 9 millimeter is a solid firearm.\\u201d \\u201cTwo to the chest, that man is going down, ten out of ten.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cHowever, I got this special military-grade ammunition over here.\\u201d \\u201cI got this here bullet.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s called a spreader.\\u201d \\u201cYeah, it\\u2019s what I used to call my ex.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cShe was a real pistol too, let me tell you.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I had to move to California. She\\u2019ll never find me here.\\u201d \\u201cSo, this bullet, when it comes out the chamber, it opens up.\\u201d \\u201cAnd when it hits, it\\u2019ll leave a hole about yay big.\\u201d And stupid me, I said this, I said, \\u201cPeople survive that?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as Jim] \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSon, you don\\u2019t want \\u2019em to survive.\\u201d \\u201cYou want \\u2019em dead as fried chicken, as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\u201d [audience applauds] I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anybody to die.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want anybody to die?!\\u201d \\u201cYou guys hear that?\\u201d \\u201cYou hear that?

Um\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019mma paint a picture for you, m\\u2019kay?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re home.\\u201d \\u201cSomeone breaks into your home.\\u201d \\u201cThey have a gun.\\u201d \\u201cYou have a gun.\\u201d \\u201cYou have already told this person to leave or you will shoot, and they\\u2019re not leavin\\u2019.\\u201d \\u201cMatter of fact, they\\u2019re doing the opposite.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re getting closer and closer and closer and closer.\\u201d \\u201cNow they\\u2019re so close, you can see the whites of their eyes.\\u201d \\u201cThis individual is standing directly in front of you.\\u201d \\u201cYou can see each other.\\u201d \\u201cThis individual is prepared to do whatever it takes to leave with whatever they want, including taking your life.\\u201d \\u201cMy question to you is, are you prepared to do the same?\\u201d \\u201cAre you willing to protect your family, your home, your valuables, and most importantly, yourself, in this situation?\\u201d \\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience cheers]\\n[as self] \\u201cFirst of all, bro.\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201cYou should sell, like, life insurance, man, \\u2019cause\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cYou\\u2019re missing your calling. I felt that. I felt it.\\u201d Um\\u2026 \\u201cIf I\\u2019m cornered like that, and I have absolutely no choice, and my life is in danger, I promise you, Jim, I will step up, man, and I will shoot them right in the leg.\\u201d \\u201cI will.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cYou think you\\u2019re gonna hit the leg, Mr. First-Time Gun Owner?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHey, if I buy that bullet you\\u2019re trying to sell me, that covers that much, up close, I can hit a leg.\\u201d \\u201cTwo steps closer, I\\u2019ll shoot him in the huevos. I will, dude.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll hit a pelota. I will. No more babies, man.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. All right. You don\\u2019t gotta get graphic on me, now.\\u201d \\u201cSon, you know what\\u2019s gonna happen if you shoot someone in your home, in the leg, and they live?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I know.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sleep better, knowing I didn\\u2019t take a life and I was able to protect my home, my family, and my stuff.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen.\\u201d [as Jim] Ah. \\u201cClearly, you\\u2019re a Disney fan.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cThat\\u2019s about the biggest fantasy I\\u2019ve ever heard, right there.\\u201d \\u201cSon, I would ask you if you knew, but clearly, you don\\u2019t, so I\\u2019m not gonna waste my time spinnin\\u2019 my wheels on this one.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna call it like it is.\\u201d \\u201cIf you shoot someone in your home and they live, they can come back and sue your ass.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. Now, here\\u2019s the kicker.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. They\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cAnd not only are they gonna get everything they wanted to get when they first broke in, when it\\u2019s all said and done, you are gonna cut them a big fat check.\\u201d \\u201cNow, what do you got to say about that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat motherfucker\\u2019s gonna die!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nHe got excited. [as Jim] \\u201cNow, we\\u2019re talkin\\u2019!\\u201d I found out something that day. I found out that people that sell guns are a lot like people that sell used cars. They play on your emotions, and then they start to upsell you and make you buy things you don\\u2019t want or need. He knew I was scared because he kept saying it to me. [as Jim] \\u201cI know you\\u2019re scared.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re scared, and your fears. You\\u2019re worried. You\\u2019re scared.\\u201d Every time he\\u2019d say \\u201cscared,\\u201d something else appeared on the counter. [audience laughs] He sold me so well that when he was done \\u201cselling me,\\u201d I wound up with four rifles\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026and four handguns and a case\\u2026 a case of spreader ammunition. [audience chuckles] I hear some of you clapping, and why? It\\u2019s excessive. I only have two hands. [audience laughs] See, I feel, again, even though my home was burglarized, I feel grateful because I wasn\\u2019t there and I had my dogs with me. I can\\u2019t replace my dogs. I can\\u2019t replace me. [audience cheering] Stuff is stuff. However, if I would have been home, I would have done whatever I needed to do. That\\u2019s the difference. In this situation, there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me, had the guns, had the ammo, glad they weren\\u2019t there, but if they were there, they would\\u2019ve done something about it. \\u2018Cause if I was in bed and I heard the\\u2026 [imitates crashing] \\u2026I would\\u2019ve jumped up. [grunting] I would\\u2019ve grabbed my gun. [imitates gun cocking] I would\\u2019ve ran out into the living room with no shirt on and one sock off.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI\\u2019d have confronted the person. \\u201cFreeze!\\u201d Knowing my luck\\u2026 [audience chuckles] [as burglar] \\u201cFluffy?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI said, freeze!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re funny. You\\u2019re funny, bro.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re funny.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cGet on the ground!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh!\\u201d [as self] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make me shoot you.\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cAh, hey!\\u201d [exclaims] \\u201cHey, Beto, get in here! Get in here! You\\u2019ll never guess whose house this is!\\u201d The other guy runs in. [as Beto] \\u201cOh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey.\\u201d \\u201cI grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience laughs and cheers] Next thing you know, I\\u2019m autographing things they\\u2019re about to take. [audience chuckles] [mouthing inaudibly] [audience laughs] [continues mouthing] [audience laughs] So like I said, in this situation, I feel like there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me. Had the guns, had the ammunition. Glad they weren\\u2019t home, but if they would have been home, they would have done something about it. That\\u2019s one type of people. The other kind of people are the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to\\u2026\\n[scattered cheering]\\nOh. Good. You\\u2019re here. [audience laughs] The kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to confront an intruder because you know you have way more guns and ammunition than they do, and you are prepared for war. [audience cheers] The kind of people who sit home at night in the living room, in the dark, holding their gun.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[imitates rifle cocking] They leave the front door unlocked to make it easier. [audience laughs] And people like that always have a friend either across the street or across town. \\u201cHow is everything over there on your side?\\u201d [imitating radio static] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all clear over here. How about you?\\u201d \\u201cYeah. Coast is clear. Ten-four. Out.\\u201d There. This situation, the break-in, left me traumatized. I couldn\\u2019t go back to living in the house because I didn\\u2019t feel safe. It\\u2019s just me and two chihuahuas. Yeah, that\\u2019s it. I\\u2019m no longer with my son\\u2019s mom, and my son lives with his mom. So, you know\\u2026 And by the way, I told my son Frankie what happened, about the break-in, and right away, right away, \\u201cOh, really? They\\u2019re lucky I wasn\\u2019t there.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cC\\u00e1lmate, John Wick.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThey would\\u2019ve kidnapped you.\\u201d \\u201cI would\\u2019ve had to pay double to get you back.\\u201d I could not go back to living at the house. Again, it\\u2019s just me. So, I put the house up for sale. Uh, yeah, I just couldn\\u2019t. And it was a big beautiful home that you guys helped pay for. Thank you. [audience chuckles] It was nice. Real nice. Freaking four bathrooms. Four bathrooms. Yeah. One penis.\\n[audience laughs]\\nEven if I ran, I couldn\\u2019t, you know\\u2026 I put the house up for sale, and here\\u2019s the dilemma that I faced. I put it up for sale before I had a new place to live because I figured I\\u2019m on the road, I\\u2019m always in a tour bus, a plane, a hotel, always somewhere. I\\u2019m on the go. I was just trying to get ahead of it because when I first bought the house, it was sitting on the market for almost two years. So I thought I had time. What happened was it sold like that because I had two people bidding on the house at the same time and they kept driving up the price. And one of the people trying to buy the house, he wanted all of my furniture and so my agent for the house goes, \\u201cGabriel, this is crazy.\\u201d \\u201cThese two guys are bidding on your house, and they want to give you way more than what you\\u2019re asking.\\u201d \\u201cOne of them wants to give you an extra $100,000 for all of your furniture.\\u201d \\u201cI suggest you take it.\\u201d And so, I did. I sold the house with everything, except the mattress. Everything. The problem is I don\\u2019t have a house right now. I don\\u2019t have anywhere to live, so technically, I\\u2019m, um\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\nFuck it. I\\u2019m homeless. I don\\u2019t care. [audience cheers] I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019m not gonna be \\u201cunhoused.\\u201d I\\u2019m homeless right now. They can\\u2019t cancel me. What are they gonna do? Take my house? I don\\u2019t have one. Ha! [audience laughs] So whatever. Mm. But no, at this point, at\\u2026 at 47 years of age, I don\\u2019t need more stuff. I\\u2019m happy that I do have stuff, but I don\\u2019t need it. What I want more than anything else now is better relationships. Better friendships, better people in my life, that\\u2019s what I want more than anything else. I announced in my last special at Dodger Stadium that I was no longer in a relationship. And I thought that was the best place to announce that because I\\u2019ve been very open about my life, my whole show is my life. People kept asking about her. So I thought that was the best place to announce that. You know what happens when you tell 50,000 people at a stadium that you\\u2019re single and then Netflix airs that around the world? I received thousands of \\u201capplications\\u201d for the Fluffy fulfillment center. Yes, I did. [chime dings] [Gabriel] That\\u2019s right, Netflix. Fluffy is hoein\\u2019 out. [audience chuckles] It was incredible. It was exciting. It was overwhelming, And it was terrifying because I didn\\u2019t know what they wanted. Um, well, I\\u2019m gonna tell you that since announcing that I was single, I\\u2019ve gone out on a few dates. And, uh, yeah. I don\\u2019t want to say how many, \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t want your judgment. [chuckles] \\u201cFluffy\\u2019s a whore.\\u201d [in English and Spanish] \\u201cHe\\u2019s nasty.\\u201d [in English] \\u201cHe\\u2019s like Santa with all his ho ho hos, yeah.\\u201d I still want to go out. I still want to have fun, I want to make connections, but unfortunately, I don\\u2019t trust people. I\\u2019m afraid. I can meet people really easy, but then I find out what they\\u2019re up to, and that sucks. Um, my heart is guarded now. Super guarded. There\\u2019s a wall and then a wall and then a wall and a wall and a wall. I\\u2019m like the only Mexican who likes walls.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo moving forward, I can tell you I don\\u2019t want to be in another relationship. I\\u2019m actually doing okay. I still want to go out, but I don\\u2019t want to be in a committed relationship. I\\u2026 I don\\u2019t. No.\\n[man boos]\\n[grunts] What do you mean, \\u201cBoo\\u201d? The fact that I\\u2019m being honest about that I don\\u2019t want to be in a relationship, I think there\\u2019s something to be said about that. I could easily lie. Meet someone, say that we\\u2019re boyfriend/girlfriend, and have a thing. But does it mean anything if your behavior doesn\\u2019t change? I\\u2019m being up front and honest. All I want\\u2026 All I want\\u2026 All I want, watch\\u2026 To the guy that booed me for saying I don\\u2019t want a relationship. Raise your hand so I can\\u2026 Okay, you\\u2019re famous, so\\u2026\\nTo you\\u2026 What is your name?\\n[man] Justin.\\nJustin?\\nDustin. Dustin. All right, Dustin. Sorry for\\u2026 \\u201cDustin!\\u201d Like, all right, \\u201cChill, bitch.\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, right? Freakin\\u2019 \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [Gabriel and audience laugh] All right, Dustin. Me not wanting to be in a traditional relationship is a honest thing because, uh, I can tell you, I don\\u2019t want to be in a situation where I\\u2019m obligated to participate in things that don\\u2019t make me feel like a good person. And at the age of 47, I\\u2019m tired of arguing, yelling, feeling guilted, feeling obligated, not smiling more. [audience cheers] I\\u2019m good, man. I\\u2026 You know\\u2026 But I still want to go out. So I just want to be up front and honest. All I need, Dustin, watch, is someone to eat with. [audience cheers] Someone to drink with. Someone to go to movies with. And someone to cuddle with. [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And they don\\u2019t even gotta be the same person.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll I\\u2019m saying is sometimes it takes a village. Okay? Dustin, I would love to tell a woman, \\u201cHey, would you like to go see a movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cYeah.\\u201d Then we go. After the movie\\u2019s over, I go, \\u201cWhat did you think?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cRight?\\u201d \\u201cWould you like to see another movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cSure. When?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNext week?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s stay in touch. See you next week.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna be so cool. You like rom-coms. I like rom-coms.\\u201d \\u201cYou like horror movies. I like horror.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna work. I like this. I need this. [grunts] Can\\u2019t wait.\\u201d So I say, \\u201cAll right, gotta go.\\u201d And she gets weird. [as woman] \\u201cWait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.\\u201d \\u201cYou gotta go? I thought this was going good.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s going great. We\\u2019ll do more next week. This is cool.\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the rush?\\u201d \\u201cWhere are you headed? Where you going?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cUh, I\\u2019m about to call the cuddler. Why?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as woman] \\u201cThe cuddler, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI got that covered.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, movies, that\\u2019s your lane. Stay in it, okay?\\u201d \\u201cThis is us. We\\u2019re good. Solid. You\\u2019re the movie girl, okay?\\u201d Now, Dustin. I didn\\u2019t tell her. But I\\u2019m gonna tell you. When it comes to the department of cuddling, and this is so crazy because I\\u2019ve always been in a relationship and I could never be this open and honest, but now that I\\u2019m single, these are Fluffy\\u2019s flavors. [audience laughs] So, when it comes to the department of cuddling, this is what I want. I want a woman. A woman. A woman. With original factory settings. [audience laughs and cheers] [speaks indistinctly] This woman needs to be equal to, or greater than, in size. She needs to be a big girl. I prefer a big girl.\\nI want a big girl.\\n[audience cheers] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. This way, we both can agree on the temperature of the thermostat. [audience laughs and applauds] And only big girls know what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. [audience laughs] See, I\\u2019m a big boy, and as a big boy, I always run hot. Heat affects my mood. When I\\u2019m hot, Dustin, I become irritable, cranky, my anxiety goes through the roof. So for me to feel comfortable, I like to set the room to 68 degrees. Okay? [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And only a big girl can truly appreciate that. Skinny women, not so much. And let me tell you, I am tired of disappointing, skinny, cold women. [audience laughs] Skinny, cold women are mean. They\\u2019re mean. They don\\u2019t want it at freakin\\u2019 68 degrees. No, they want 72, 73, 74. [in Spanish] You\\u2019re killing me. No! [in English] But I can\\u2019t do that to them. I can\\u2019t put them in 68 degrees. They get snippy. They get evil. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh my God. What\\u2019s your problem?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cWell, fuckin\\u2019 eat something.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] \\u201cI\\u2019m tired of sweating.\\u201d But, yeah. Anyway, Dustin, I apologize. I wasn\\u2019t trying to turn this into a TED Talk. [audience chuckles] I don\\u2019t want you to think that I don\\u2019t believe in love because I do, and anyone who can pull it off, I commend you for it. I have met so many couples over the years. I\\u2019ve met 20-year couples, 30-year couples, 40-year couples, 50-year couples. I met one 55.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. Yeah. I call them unicorns. I\\u2019ll tell you the story. I was in Savannah, Georgia. And I had just finished filming the second Magic Mike movie. Now\\u2026 Yeah, I know. For those of you that don\\u2019t know, I was in Magic Mike. [audience cheers] Yes. I know. I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. [audience laughs] Magic Mike, not Tragic Mike. So, let\\u2019s remember that, okay? I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. So, um\\u2026 Here\\u2019s the thing, after the movie, after we wrapped, my manager, Joe, tells me, he says, \\u201cDude, man.\\u201d \\u201cCongratulations on another project.\\u201d \\u201cI want to take you out for a steak dinner.\\u201d I said, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d So he takes me to this restaurant called Ruth\\u2019s Chris Steak House. Now, very popular chain around the country. We go there, we sit down, and here comes the server and the server\\u2019s real bubbly. \\u201cHey, guys. What\\u2019s going on? Are we celebrating anything today?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes, we are.\\u201d \\u201cWell, guess what? You\\u2019re not the only ones.\\u201d \\u201cYou see that couple over there?\\u201d \\u201cThat couple is celebrating 55 years of marriage today.\\u201d And we\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d So, we look. [whoosh]\\n[audience chuckles]\\nI said, \\u201cHow come they\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as server] \\u201cI wondered the same thing, but the man made it a point to say 55 years.\\u201d \\u201cI thought that was pretty impressive.\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, it is.\\u201d So he leaves to go get us some sodas and some bread. And I tell my manager, I said, \\u201cHey, Joe, listen.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019mma go say hi to the couple real quick.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t get us kicked out.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make it like last time.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s not gonna be.\\u201d So I get up, and I push in my chair, and I make my way over to the couple. Now, I understand how important this night is for them. I know exactly how long it took to get to that point, and I am not trying to mess that up. But I have questions. [audience chuckles] And these two people are clearly professionals in that department. So I approached the table as tactfully as I could. And I said, \\u201cPardon the interruption.\\u201d \\u201cIt has come to my attention that we are celebrating 55 years of marriage.\\u201d And the man was so happy that someone acknowledged that. He was just thrilled. He\\u2019s like\\u2026 [breathing excitedly] [as older man] \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, son.\\u201d \\u201cFifty-five years ago today, this lovely lady sittin\\u2019 next to me right here said I do, and we\\u2019ve been together ever since.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cThat is beautiful.\\u201d \\u201cMay I ask you a question?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cAbsolutely.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHow come you\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience chuckles] [laughs as older man] \\u201cHe wants to know how come we\\u2019re\\u2026 Laugh, goddammit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cSon, when you\\u2019ve been together as long as the two of us have, you might\\u2019ve seen a thing or two.\\u201d Uh, uh\\u2026 \\u201cWe have children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.\\u201d \\u201cWe have traveled this great big world of ours many times over.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re both retired military.\\u201d \\u201cWe have seen the best in people.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, unfortunately, when you\\u2019re around and alive as long as the two of us have been, uh, you\\u2019ve unfortunately seen the worst in people as well.\\u201d \\u201cWe have had just about every type of conversation there is to have. [audience chuckles] At least twice. [audience laughs] And after 55 years of marriage, well, hell, we\\u2019re just trying to enjoy each other\\u2019s company, even if it\\u2019s in silence.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve had every type of conversation there is to have?\\u201d And I guess I triggered him, because he was like, \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been in combat.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can faze me.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can surprise me anymore.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t say.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] So, I took a step towards them, I grab my shirt, and I flash them. [audience laughs] And then I walked away. And you know what happened next? They started talking! [audience laughs and cheers] I gave that couple the greatest gift they will never ever acknowledge. Something new, something spontaneous, something outrageous, something neither one of them had ever seen before. I gave them a new story. I promise you, every year moving forward, all they\\u2019re gonna talk about is what happened at 55. [as older man] \\u201cRemember, honey. Remember when that Samoan flashed us?\\u201d [audience laughs] Right. \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m a giver. I remember many, many years ago, before there was a venue like this to perform in, the only place around here for comedians to do shows was at a comedy club right outside these doors that was part of the original layout of the casino. [audience cheers] It was a club called The Improv. There\\u2019s a chain all over. [audience cheers] And, you know, many, many years ago, before all of this, that\\u2019s where Martin and myself, my buddy Alfred, we\\u2019d go do shows at the\\u2026 at the club. And the first time we got a chance to perform there, I didn\\u2019t really have a name. I wasn\\u2019t really established yet. And I want to take this moment to acknowledge and thank one person who was super, super helpful in that, a man by the name of DJ Laz.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s right, people. The Pimp with the Limp. Oh, yeah, Pap\\u00e1. Yeah. \\u201cIt\\u2019s your boy, DJ Laz.\\u201d I love him, man. He\\u2019s great. He\\u2019s awesome. But yeah, he walks in circles. He does. He walks in circles. Nice guy. DJ Laz was one of the first people to allow me to be on morning radio with him, and he helped promote my shows. Not only would he allow me to go on his show and promote my shows, he would come to my shows, and he would bring people, and he\\u2019d watch and he\\u2019d sit and hang out and laugh. The man has a million things he can do in Miami, but he\\u2019d come watch my show. And then the next day, \\u201cPap\\u00e1, come on the radio with me.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna talk about your show.\\u201d And he would help me sell out these shows year after year after year. So, Laz, I know you\\u2019re watching, Pap\\u00e1. Thank you. This is part of you, Pap\\u00e1. Muchas gracias. Thank you. Thank you. But that was many years down the line. In the beginning, the first time I performed at that comedy club, right outside these doors, that\\u2019s no longer there\\u2026 Um, I\\u2019m talking to the marketing person. Now, keep in mind, this is so long ago, there was no social media. There was no TikTok, no freaking Twitter, no Facebook, none of that. The only way you could promote yourself back then was, you had to get on morning radio, morning news, have somebody do a write-up on you in the newspaper. Remember those? Yeah. And then, of course, word-of-mouth, which is always the best. Uh, they had posters at the comedy club. And so, the marketing guy goes, \\u201cGabriel.\\u201d \\u201cHelp me help you help us.\\u201d \\u201cWe want to sell tickets. How do you want to be promoted?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWell\\u2026\\u201d Keep in mind, long time ago. I said, \\u201cUm, this is how I want you to promote my show.\\u201d \\u201cPlease use a photo.\\u201d \\u201cUnder the photo, put my name, Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t have the nickname Fluffy yet. That\\u2019s how long ago this was. I said, \\u201cUnderneath that, please put, \\u2018As seen on Comedy Central.'\\u201d Because at the time, that was the only television credit I had. So the marketing guy goes, \\u201cWell, I was thinking, what about, \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and his amigos\\u2019?\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201c\\u2018Amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWhy \\u2018amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cBecause I have other Mexicans with me?\\u201d And he looked at me and said, \\u201cGood. You get it.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like that. What about \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and friends\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWell, we want to put a couple of buzzwords out there to let the community know what type of show it is.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat type of show is it?\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cIt\\u2019s a special show.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel special.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cGabriel, hear me out. What about like a taco Tuesday?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cOkay, what about salsa night?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cSalsa night?\\u201d \\u201cWait, like dancing or chips and guac?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cEither one, I don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d I could not believe I was having this conversation, and I wanted to get upset. I wanted to go off on this guy for trying to make me feel like less of a person, right? But I didn\\u2019t, because I knew that if I went off on them, I would have been seen as difficult. I would have been seen as a problem, and I would not have been given another opportunity to come back. When people ask me, \\u201cWhat do you credit for your success?\\u201d Of course, talent, showing up, doing what you gotta do. But one word that gets left out a lot is the word \\u201csacrifice.\\u201d I had to sacrifice something that day, and a lot of people think they know what sacrifice means but honestly, until you have to make one, I don\\u2019t think you do. I had to sacrifice my pride because as much as I wanted to go off on this guy, I knew that if I did, I\\u2019d be shooting myself in the foot. I knew that if they could see what I could do on that stage, they\\u2019d have to bring me back, and they\\u2019d have to treat me different.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo as much as it hurt, as much as it sucked, I allowed that stupid taco Tuesday to happen. So, for me, I was very upset. I was wondering, is this something that happens to all new comedians, or was I being singled out? It was killing me. I needed to know. I couldn\\u2019t just take out my phone and google it because that wasn\\u2019t an option all those years back. So what I had to do was I had to go to the front door of the club where they had a bin, and the bin had flyers in it. So I grabbed the flyer, and I looked at it. And the flyer had the list of upcoming comedy shows. And I was so upset when I saw it because all it was, was pictures, names, and television credits. No silly names, no theme nights, no \\u201cspicy this\\u201d or \\u201ccrazy that.\\u201d Just comedy. So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this stupid taco Tuesday thing to me?\\u201d So I said, \\u201cLet me try to find another comedian who\\u2019s a little bit more in my vein.\\u201d If you know what I mean. The only other comedian I could find was a man by the name of George Lopez.\\n[audience cheers]\\nWith George\\u2019s promo, however, it was just a picture, name, and underneath that, a television credit that said, \\u201cAs seen on ABC.\\u201d That\\u2019s it. It didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cLikes to ride a donkey, George Lopez,\\u201d \\u201cEats a burrito with both hands, George Lopez.\\u201d \\u201cAy, ay, ay. I just jumped the wall. It\\u2019s George Lopez.\\u201d No! So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this to me?\\u201d So then I said, \\u201cAll right, all right.\\u201d \\u201cLet me see how they promote the Black comedians.\\u201d And with the Black comedians, it was the same thing. Picture, name, television credit, and that\\u2019s it. Unless it was a show that had multiple Black comedians on it because if the comedy club had a show with three or more Black comics on it, they would put a catchy name to it. They would call the show \\u201cUrban Night\\u201d or \\u201cApollo Night\\u201d or \\u201cDef Jam Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBET Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBlack-ish Comedy Night.\\u201d But that\\u2019s as far as they would go. They wouldn\\u2019t go to the next level like they would for me. Oh, yeah. There was no \\u201cMargarita Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTaco Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWetback Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTortilla Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFiesta Friday,\\u201d or \\u201cS\\u00e1bado Gigante\\u201d! No. That would never happen to Black people. Are you kidding me? You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMalt Liquor Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTupac Tuesday,\\u201d or \\u201cWatermelon Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cThong, Th-Thong, Thong Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFried Chicken Friday\\u201d or \\u201cSookie-Sookie Saturday\\u201d or \\u201cSlap-a-Ho Sunday\\u201d!\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nAnd that most definitely will not happen to white people. [audience chuckling] [scattered cheers] [speaks inaudibly] [cheering grows louder] Oh, I\\u2019mma do the joke. And you know why you can laugh and enjoy and not feel threatened by what I\\u2019m about to say? Because, like what I said earlier tonight, I am here to entertain, I am not here to offend. I\\u2019m here to have fun with everybody, starting with me. Plus, it\\u2019ll never happen. You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMonster Truck Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTrailer Park Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWhite Trash Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTake Your Sister Out Thursday.\\u201d [audience laughs] [in Southern accent] \\u201cOh, hell no, Fluffy! You done crossed the line now!\\u201d \\u201cMy name is Dustin, and I don\\u2019t play that shit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m from Davie, goddammit.\\u201d [audience cheers] Next time, stay quiet. [audience laughs] So\\u2026 I was talking to Martin backstage before I came out, and he goes, \\u201cAre you gonna share the story about the theme nights thing that happened at The Improv here, and y\\u2019know?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, y\\u2019know, I think I should, Martin.\\u201d \\u201cI think I should tell the story about, y\\u2019know, the theme nights.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cGabe, can I tell you something about that theme nights bit?\\u201d I go, \\u201cTell me, Martin.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cDo you realize that in all the years I have heard you tell this story about what happened at that club, do you understand that you\\u2019ve never once finished the week?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cMartin, you know why that is, right?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s the rule of comedy.\\u201d \\u201cYou always want to end on the biggest laugh.\\u201d \\u201cThursday gets the biggest laugh, which is why I stopped at Thursday.\\u201d And Martin goes, \\u201cI know, I know, I know.\\u201d \\u201cBut you\\u2019re robbing white people of their week.\\u201d [audience laughs] I never looked at it that way. \\u201cFox News Friday.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cStorm the Capitol Saturday.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cSay You\\u2019re Sorry Sunday\\u201d! [audience cheers] Are we still havin\\u2019 a good time? [audience cheers] Are we still having fun? [cheering grows louder] That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. People laughing, not getting upset, not getting offended, not freakin\\u2019 making a stink. And let me tell you right now, for the five people who have never heard of me before, this\\u2026 is for you. [scattered cheers] I get pulled over one night, two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-through. [audience cheering knowingly] I made a left turn instead of making a right turn, but I wasn\\u2019t paying attention, \\u2019cause I had a box, right? I was like, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d [chuckles enthusiastically] [exclaims, chuckles] \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d I make a wrong turn all of a sudden. [imitates siren] [groans] [imitates vehicle approaching] [grunts sadly] \\u201cLater.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[gibbers indistinctly] The officer is taking forever. I said, \\u201cForget this.\\u201d I grab the box of donuts. I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. I was like\\u2026 [inhales sharply] Mm! [chuckles] Ah! [exclaims wildly] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou know why I stopped you?\\u201d It was too easy. I picked up the box, and I said\\u2026 [with audience] \\u201c\\u2018Cause you can smell it!\\u201d [audience cheering] [crowd chanting] Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! [audience continues cheering] [chime dings] [Gabriel] You\\u2019re probably wondering, why did we pause the special again? Well, I just want to let you guys know most comedians would\\u2019ve already said, \\u201cThank you, good night,\\u201d gone home, cashed their Netflix checks, and hope they get another phone call. \\u201cPlease call me, Netflix.\\u201d [inhales] But this guy is not most comedians. That\\u2019s what happens when you hire a Mexican. We love overtime. [audience cheering] Thank you for still wanting to hear a joke that\\u2019s over 20 years old. [audience cheers] I grew up watching you too. [audience laughs] Got chills when I\\u2026 [in Spanish] Look, look. [audience laughs] [in English] That was beautiful. I love you too, and that\\u2026 Seriously, you guys, thank you for that. Thank you. [audience cheers] Thank you. There are fans, and then there\\u2019s what you just did right now. [audience cheering] I don\\u2019t know any other comedian that gets this type of love and loyalty. Thank you so much. I\\u2019m not getting off the stage yet \\u2019cause I still got more to go, but I want to say thank you for that. [audience cheers] Thank you. [sighs dramatically]\\n[audience cheering]\\n[Gabriel] Whoo! So when I started doing stand-up in 1997, the only place that would allow me to go up on stage and do what I do were bars. Dive bars, rough bars. Uh, Martin and I, that\\u2019s where we met, many, many years ago. We\\u2019re performing at this bar in Montebello, California, and, uh, you had to fight with the crowd. You had to fight because there was noise. There were TVs on. People were drinking, smoking\\u2026 People were doing everything in there but paying attention. So you had to come out quick, trying to get them to laugh. And one night, this comedian pulls me aside, and he goes, \\u201cHey, kid.\\u201d And when he called me kid, I got upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI could drink.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was 20, 21 years old, and, you know, even though I thought I was grown, I wasn\\u2019t. I wasn\\u2019t grown. Uh, I got upset that he pulled me aside. He goes, \\u201cCan I give you some advice?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWho does this guy think he is? I\\u2019m funnier than him.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I thought because at the age of 21, I was a punk. I really was. And so, I don\\u2019t know what got into me where I said, \\u201cSure, I\\u2019ll hear you out.\\u201d And I just stood there, and he said, \\u201cListen.\\u201d \\u201cUm, you\\u2019re really likeable on stage, and that\\u2019s rare.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna give you a bit of advice.\\u201d \\u201cIf you cut all the cussing out of your show and start taking the filthy material out, I think you\\u2019re gonna have a long career ahead of you.\\u201d And I know I said \\u201ctake the cussing out\\u201d and I\\u2026 I said the F-word twice tonight. [audience chuckles] Technically, no, three times. I said it three times. Um, but I\\u2019m mindful of it. I\\u2019m keeping count. It\\u2019s not every other word. Plus, we\\u2019re in a casino. [audience cheers] Okay. No one loses their ass and says, \\u201cAw, shucks.\\u201d No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI heard some of you cussing before. \\u201cWhen the fuck is this gonna start?\\u201d Yeah, I heard you. I heard you. [in Spanish] I\\u2019m fat, not deaf. [in English] I heard you, goddammit. So anyway, he gives me this advice. Cut the cussing out of your show, take out the filthy material. And I don\\u2019t know why I listen, but I did, and he was absolutely right. All of a sudden, I started getting opportunities left and right. I started getting booked at colleges, high schools, churches, fairs. And then the big one, casinos. [audience cheers] [cheering fades] Back in the day, you had to be squeaky-clean to perform at a casino. Uh, but that\\u2019s not the case anymore. If you can sell tickets, it doesn\\u2019t matter what you do, they want to book you. But back in the day, there was only a few people who could pull it off. I was fortunate to be one of those people. So I remember, I got booked to perform at a casino called Morongo in Southern California, and I\\u2019m backstage with the booker, the lady that hired me for the function, and she goes, \\u201cSo, no cussing, right?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. No cussing.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cNo filthy material?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNo filthy material.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cGood luck.\\u201d And it was just me. I didn\\u2019t have openers. It was just me. It was a voice-over on the frickin\\u2019 speaker, right? \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome comedian, funny man Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d And then I just\\u2026 I walked out there, right? I offended the entire audience\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026in five seconds. And I did it without cussing. Frickin\\u2019 22-year-old kid goes up on stage, looks at the crowd and says, \\u201cHey, everybody! Is this a regular casino, or is this an Indian casino?\\u201d [audience groans and laughs] You see how you all know?\\n[audience laughs]\\nI didn\\u2019t know. I didn\\u2019t know because I didn\\u2019t have TikTok to teach me. [audience chuckles] What I did have was a life experience that I\\u2019ll never forget. As soon as I said that, the entire front row, which comprised of the tribal members from the casino, they all stood up, and one of them called me out in front of the entire audience. \\u201cHey! Hey! You don\\u2019t say that anymore!\\u201d \\u201cThe proper term is Native American.\\u201d \\u201cPlease show respect.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh my God. I\\u2019m so sorry. I didn\\u2019t know.\\u201d And I felt horrible, and I was so embarrassed. Fortunately, I had a second show at ten o\\u2019clock. Ten o\\u2019clock hits. I take the stage. I didn\\u2019t need to be told a thousand times that I messed up. That one time of me getting shamed in front of the entire audience was all I needed. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m a firm believer in shaming. [audience laughs] I think shaming is good. Shaming is good as long as you shame with purpose. If you\\u2019re about to teach someone a valuable lesson, I say go for it because it worked for me. I got shamed one time. Second show, ten o\\u2019clock. I took the stage. Ooh, it was different. I was like, \\u201cBefore I get started, ladies and gentlemen, I\\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Native Americans who are here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cThank you for this opportunity to perform in your casino.\\u201d \\u201cI hope you enjoy the performance.\\u201d [audience cheers and laughs] I thought I was good. All of a sudden, another tribal member in the back jumped up. And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey, drop the \\u2018American\\u2019! Just say \\u2018Native\\u2019!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201c\\u2018Kay!\\u201d [audience laughs] That stayed with me. That was powerful. That was scary. Next time I did a casino, first thing I said was, \\u201cI would like to acknowledge all of the Natives who are here tonight,\\u201d and then someone yelled out, \\u201cWe\\u2019re Indigenous!\\u201d Fuck me! That\\u2019s four. [audience laughs and cheers] [chime dings] With time, I got a chance to perform all across the United States, and then I get my first-ever show in Canada. Ironically enough, at a casino. [audience laughs] It\\u2019s a casino we still perform at called Caesars in the city of Windsor, Ontario, right across the water from Detroit, Michigan. [audience cheers] I come to find out the hard way that in Canada, it is a completely different term for describing the\\u2026 people\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026originally from that land. The proper term in Canada is actually \\u201cFirst Nation.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t know that. I was so nervous being in Canada, I said, \\u201cNative American.\\u201d [audience laughs] Like, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I\\u2019m not even in America, right? Frickin\\u2019 stupid, right? Pendejo, I know. [audience laughs] Fortunately, someone pulled me to the side, and they told me what was up. I was lucky that I had a second show. Ten o\\u2019clock, I take the stage, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBefore I begin, I would like to acknowledge all of the First Nation people who are here tonight.\\u201d Then some guy yells out, \\u201cCall us Indians!\\u201d [audience laughs] This guy in the front row was like\\u2026 [in Indian accent] \\u201cThey\\u2019re not Indian.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[in Indian accent] \\u201cThey are not Indian!\\u201d [as self] Canada has always been an adventure. There was one show that we did at the same casino. Anytime now, we perform outside of the United States, even if it\\u2019s next door in Canada or Mexico, Martin\\u2019s first question to the audience is, \\u201cDo we have any Americans in the house tonight?\\u201d Because no matter where we perform in the world, there\\u2019s always a handful. So that night, Martin takes the stage, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans here tonight?\\u201d Not knowing that earlier in the day, at that same casino, in the grand ballroom, there was a\\u2026 a end-of-year holiday party from an American company from right across the water in Detroit. And they were having this end-of-year celebration, and they were there, pre-gaming since noon. [audience chuckles] Partying it up. And I guess the\\u2026 the party planner for the event thought it would be an amazing idea to end their party with laughter. So this person bought all of the tickets to my show that night and gave them to that company. Well, seven o\\u2019clock rolls around, and everybody stumbles in, takes their seats, and then Martin walks out, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans?\\u201d And instead of getting a \\u201cYay,\\u201d \\u201cWhoo,\\u201d \\u201cRight here,\\u201d he got\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] They were so drunk, they started chanting. \\u201cUSA! USA! USA! USA!\\u201d I\\u2019m in the dressing room, hearing this. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are we here?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cWe could have done this in Detroit.\\u201d You know? I had to fill out paperwork. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis is not cool.\\u201d So during intermission, Martin comes backstage and he tells me, \\u201cBro, I don\\u2019t know if you heard\\u2026\\u201d [as self] \\u201cOh, I heard.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cMight wanna mention it.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOh, I will.\\u201d So at some point during my performance, I told the audience, \\u201cSo, a little bird told me there might be a couple of Americans here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cIs that true?\\u201d Sure enough\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] And they started doing it again. [chanting] \\u201cUSA! USA! USA!\\u201d Then it got quiet, and you could hear, \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, do you understand what just happened?\\u201d \\u201cWe just made history.\\u201d And people in the front row, they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about, history?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWe just made history.\\u201d \\u201cWho would have ever thought you\\u2019d see the day where thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of Americans would cross a border\\u2026\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\u2026to see a Mexican?\\u201d\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you for 27 years of supporting this Mexican.\\n[in Spanish] Miami, I love you so much.

Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\\u2013 There\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all.\\n\\u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\\u201d\\nI live\\u2013 I live in New York. I always\\u2013 Like, there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\\u2019s always walking her dog. She\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\\u2013 The two of them, it\\u2019s really\\u2013 The dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\\u2013 And she\\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\\u201910\\u201d, But now it\\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \\u201cyecch, no thank you. \\u201cI do not want those. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \\u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\\u2019s no\\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \\u201cgood morning, gladys,\\u201d She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cgood,\\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \\u201c\\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n\\u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\\u201d\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\\u2019s a weird moment, too, \\u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \\u201cyeah, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \\u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \\u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \\u201cwhy did he die, da\\u2013\\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\\u2019s the reason. That\\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead. He didn\\u2019t know his name, and he didn\\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\\u2019t know which one. I don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\\u2019t. They don\\u2019t care, and we don\\u2019t care. There\\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \\u201cok, everybody. \\u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\\u2013you know what?\\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\\u201d And we would all be like, \\u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\\u201d Anyway, so we\\u2019re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\\u2019s going\\u2013 They\\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \\u201cbaa,\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\\u2019re like\\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 They go\\u2013 My daughter\\u2019s like, \\u201cwhat is he saying?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know! \\u201cI\\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\\u201d\\n\\u201cThe Food Chain\\u201d\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\\u2019re in the food chain. You\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\\u2019s how all life ends, is\\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \\u201cI love you. Bye.\\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \\u201cbeh,\\u201d and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cfine,\\u201d And it\\u2019s just, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\\u2019t get it! Then you\\u2019re walking to work like, \\u201cwhy do I even bother? \\u201cshit! Goddamn it! \\u201cthere\\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\\u201d You think that sharks\\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\\u2019d be bummed \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \\u201chey, nobody has any idea what\\u2019s down here,\\u201d And we\\u2019re all up here like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s totally a shark right there.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\\u2013 \\u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\\u2019s why animals just\\u2013 They go, \\u201clet\\u2019s do this together, man. \\u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\\u201d That\\u2019s why they do it like that. \\u201cfuck it. I\\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cgrownups ain\\u2019t worth the meat.\\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n\\u201cCourtyard Confrontation\\u201d\\nI live in New York city, and it\\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\\u2019m not used to it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\\u2019t get a fountain made without\\u2013 \\u201ccan you make me a fountain?\\u201d \\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll get started right away! \\u201cYes! Yes! It\\u2019s finished!\\u201d And it\\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \\u201cjust piss on me forever!\\u201d Anyway, there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\\u2026 And so I\\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\\u2019s looking at me like, \\u201c\\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \\u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \\u201c\\u201d And then I see him go, \\u201cno. That\\u2019s not gonna do at all,\\u201d And he comes over to me, \\u201c\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNum num num!\\u201d I\\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \\u201crrgh!\\u201d So he comes over, says, \\u201cexcuse me, \\u201cdo you live in this building?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there? I said, \\u201cno.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI just need to rest. I\\u2019m having a hard time.\\u201d He says, \\u201cthis is private property,\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, I don\\u2019t really believe in that.\\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t leave, I\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\\u201d I was like, \\u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\\u201d So he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno,\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \\u201cno. That guy lives here. It\\u2019s OK,\\u201d And the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\\u2013 It was just so\\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings. That\\u2019s how excited I was.\\n\\u201cGetting What \\u2018Old\\u2019 Is\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m 45 now, So I\\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\\u2019t know which one. I won\\u2019t know till it\\u2019s over where this was. I don\\u2019t know how long I\\u2019m gonna live. I don\\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad.\\u201d If I die five years from now, they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cwell, all right,\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 It\\u2019s\\u2013 Like, as soon as you\\u2019re 50, you\\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\\u2019re in the news, and it\\u2019s always some old guy, \\u201cI met Napoleon.\\u201d No, you didn\\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwow, this seems early for this.\\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\\u2019ll realize, \\u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\\u2019s just like, \\u201cJust\\u2013 \\u201d My asshole\\u2013 My asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \\u201crats.\\u201d That\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\\u2019m\\u2013 OK. Say I\\u2019m sitting down. If I\\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\\u2013ha ha ha!\\u2013 I love sitting so much\\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\\u2013 At my age, if I\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \\u201cwhat? Why do I\\u2013 no. Why, though?\\u201d \\u201cYour car is being towed right now!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\\u2019s\\u2013 I accept that.\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \\u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\\u201d Like, let\\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \\u201c\\u201d like I\\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \\u201cshit.\\u201d\\n\\u201cPutting On Socks\\u201d\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\\u2013 Here\\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\\u2019t even know how I do it. I\\u2019m sitting here. I don\\u2019t know how I do that. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 It\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\\u2013 I\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \\u201cbeep, beep, beep!\\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \\u201cOK. That\\u2019s hard.\\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n\\u201cIf You\\u2019re Older You\\u2019re Smarter\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right. It means that even if they\\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\\u2019ve been there longer. If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\\u2019s the interesting thing. There\\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\\u2019t clap. Why? \\u2019cause they\\u2019re smart. They\\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to clap. I don\\u2019t have to do anything.\\u201d They\\u2019re not doing it, and they\\u2019re right. You know why? \\u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m asking. How do you know what\\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\\u2019s every time. \\u201cWhoo! Whoo!\\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\\u2019re not the only people here. That\\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\\u2013 \\u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\\u2019t have it! I don\\u2019t have it!\\u201d If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \\u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\\u2019s seen more. He\\u2019s seen history. He\\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \\u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \\u201cthe president\\u2019s kind of disappointing.\\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n\\u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\\u201d\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \\u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \\u201chey, I\\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\\u201d \\u201cso where do I\\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\\u2019d like to make one of those \\u201cit gets better\\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \\u201clisten, man. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s tough right now. \\u201cYou\\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \\u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \\u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \\u201cbut it gets better because you\\u2019ll all grow up, \\u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \\u201cand they don\\u2019t. \\u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \\u201cand you\\u2019re gonna be there. \\u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \\u201cbefore she hits the ground. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna be so great. \\u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \\u201cto match your looks, but it\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cWhen real shit matters, you\\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\\u201d It\\u2019s just time. That\\u2019s all it takes. There\\u2019s a formula to this. It\\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n\\u201cEverybody Has Their Time\\u201d\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone.\\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\\u2019s all that happens, \\u201caww,\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \\u201cAww.\\u201d Well, go fuck one. \\u201cNah.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t think so. That\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \\u201cyeah. No. You should. I\\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\\u201d\\n\\u201cDating Takes Courage\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\\u2013 It\\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\\u2019t do this!\\u201d But he walked up and said, \\u201chi. Yes,\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\\u201d Sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\\u2019s the whole thing. That\\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \\u201cdude, I can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\\u201d But women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah. I\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\\u201d What are you, nuts? \\u201cI\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\\u201d \\u201cTo your death, statistically.\\u201d How do they still do it? If you\\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI hope this one\\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFirst Date\\u201d\\nI always\\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together And she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha! \\u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\\u2026\\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cthat was good. He\\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\\u201d And he has no idea. He\\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there.\\n\\u201cTits\\u201d\\nGuys are\\u2013 We love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 And we just look at you. That\\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Like they\\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \\u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\\u201d And 100% of us will go, \\u201cyes, of course.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \\u201cyeah. Ok.\\u201d Beep! \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019s not your tits. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 You don\\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit. \\u201cthank you, Deborah. I\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\\u201d It\\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d Which I don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d But that\\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d There\\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that!\\u201d \\u201cthe end.\\u201d \\u201cmy god! \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\\u2013 And you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \\u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\\u201d That\\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\\u2019s, once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\\u2019t get the second one. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit.\\u201d \\u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \\u201cI like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\\u201d And if it\\u2019s up to the guy, we\\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \\u201cyou know what? \\u201cI\\u2019m good with the one. That\\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\\u201d We\\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 \\u201cyeah\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cthere\\u2019s a bomb!\\u201d \\u201cshit! Come on, let\\u2019s get\\u2013 \\u201ccome on! Let\\u2019s get your tits out of here!\\u201d\\n\\u201cDivorce\\u201d\\nI\\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\\u2019ve seen\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 48 maybe. I don\\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\\u2019m not saying don\\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\\u2019s the best part. It\\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \\u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\\u2019s over. I can\\u2019t take it.\\u201d And again, if you\\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\\u2019s just a fact. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s true. Everything\\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\\u2019m a good father. I\\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \\u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\\u2019s like every parent\\u2019s fantasy. Who can\\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \\u201cgood-bye, girls. \\u201cDaddy\\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m such a good dad.\\n\\u201cVideoing Your Kids\\u201d\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\\u2019s there, and everybody\\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \\u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 There\\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \\u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \\u201cmy god! \\u201cit\\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\\u201d And guess what? They\\u2019re not watching it, either. They\\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \\u201cthat\\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\\u201d Nobody\\u2019s watching your kids\\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\\u201d\\n\\u201cLife Is A Good Deal\\u201d\\nDon\\u2019t tape shit on your\\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 Here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything, You just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Every time I\\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \\u201cI could die right now,\\u201d and I mean it! That\\u2019s how good life is. You get to\\u2013 you get to fuck. That\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\\u2019s your buddy. If you\\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\\u2019m not worried about it ending.\\n\\u201cBehind The Wheel\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty good, and I\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\\u2019t know. You know, it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\\u2019re driving, That\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \\u201cworthless piece of shit.\\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \\u201cWorthless piece of shit\\u201d? That\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son. And things I\\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 I don\\u2019t remember, even\\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d? \\u201cworthless piece of shit!\\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d I said that to a person. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d Why? \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\\u2019d like to think that I\\u2019m a nice person, But I don\\u2019t know, man.\\n\\u201cIf Murder Was Legal\\u201d\\nA lot of it is context. There\\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019d love to think, \\u201cI would never do that,\\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause, Like, \\u201cI would never do that.\\u201d No. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\\u2019t like them. \\u201cI never killed anybody.\\u201d \\u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \\u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\\u201d \\u201cI think he\\u2019s nice.\\u201d \\u201cshut up, Janet.\\u201d They would just\\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\\u2019d go to a mall, there\\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\\u2019t listen to me!\\u201d Just\\u2013pbbt! There\\u2019d be just\\u2013 You\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross. \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment. \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of America. \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n\\u201cOf Course, But Maybe\\u201d\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\\u2013 That\\u2019s the thing I believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing, and I don\\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \\u201cof course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \\u201chow did they build those pyramids?\\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\\u2019re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.”\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!”\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.”\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.”\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!”\\n♪ A whole new world ♪\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.”\\nI’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!”\\nI don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore.\\nI’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.”\\nI can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody.

            "then he beat my ass, actually. is that a hate crime? i think i got hate-crimed, dude. i knew i thought i got hate-crimed. but here’s the wild part of that story. here’s where the lord really steps in. because the fellow that got ejact onto me… he died. he died. he died. he died. [repeats] he died. he died… he died in a car accident. he died of natural causes by a car. sometimes i’ll be sitting somewhere… thinking or not thinking about something, waiting for a thought to come and find me. and i’ll feel like… let me say this right. i will feel like… this is, like, his arm a little. i swear to god, man. because i’ll just be sitting there doing nothing, or maybe doing something. and my hand will go like that. but i won’t want nothing. but it’s like he wants something. like he trying to get something. like he wants a candy. ‘cause i wouldn’t be reaching for no candies ’cause i know we don’t keep candies in the house. it’s like he’s reaching for a candy, like, he trying to get a butterscotch. the second time i was gay was when i met brad pitt. ‘cause i met brad pitt, dude. i did. i met brad pitt. the real one, the only one god ever made. met his ass, okay? this is what happened. listen up, haters. so it’s a beautiful day out. ‘cause brad only lives on beautiful days. and i’m walking. i’m going to an audition on the fox lot in los angeles. probably for a big movie like league of their own ii or something heavy. the sun is hitting me while i walk. the rays are just coming down and just touching me on my neck and hair. like the lord just petting me, letting me know i’m still his boy. in the distance i see a man, right? i say a man, but i’m talking about the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen wrapped up in a man. he didn’t even look human. he looked like… poseidon had been raising a secret little baby boy down in the ocean. and when that boy was full grown, he set him on the land and said, “go, boy. you live out there now.”\n",
            "immediately, i was gay. okay? like– poof– gay. so, i’m walking and he’s walking, we’re both going to the same building. it’s a true story. i don’t even know if brad pitt even walks anymore, or if there’s an agreement now between gravity and mother nature and the grace of god, where they just amicably move little bradley wherever he needs to go. like, god has a chessboard with one piece and it’s brad-fucking-pitt. checkmate life, right? so, i’m walking, he’s gliding. we’re both going to the same building, i’m looking at him, and i’m thinking to myself, “man, that looks like brad pitt.” and then my brain goes, “‘cause that is brad pitt, playboy.”\n",
            "part of my brain is black and gets a little ‘hood with the rest of my brain. i don’t know what to do now, ’cause they don’t teach you what to do when you’re about to meet brad pitt. they teach us other things. if you’re on fire, little buddy, stop, drop and roll. if you’re going to argue with a short man, don’t argue with him in a prone position. argue with him like this and be ready for his little actions. but they don’t teach you how to meet brad-frikking-pitt in brad-frikking-person, right? so i’m walking, he’s gliding. we’re going to the same building, me and the only brad pitt god ever made. brad pitt. and he was wearing– he was wearing everything. he had on, like, a tuxedo. and he was on a horseback. and he had on furs, but, like, exotic furs. animals we’ve never even seen, like, chimpanebras and alapacakeets. and he had lorax coming off his shoulders, and he had care bear cuff on his boot-tops and wrists. and… he had no shirt on. so he’s coming from that way, i’m coming this way. double doors on the building. we get to the front of this building at the same moment, and i’m thinking to myself, “i’ll get the door, ’cause brad’s done a lot for me.”\n",

            "we used to play games like catch or don’t. and my favorite: “is dad sleeping, or is he no longer with us?” “it’s your turn to hold the mirror under his nose.” my mom used to make us hold a mirror under his nose when he was taking a nap to see if it would fog up or not. i swear to god, not joking. and the kids at school would be like, “well, my dad could beat up your dad.” i’d be like, “no shit, man.” your dad has more organs than my dad… but my dad used to bang your grandmother. back before they had protection, when all you wore was hope. “you got any condoms?” “no, but i got this here.” that’s that alabama birth control, baby. and it’s crossin’ state lines. and my friends are like, “theo, you shouldn’t make fun of your conception. you should be happy you were born. you were that lucky sperm.” i’m like, “lucky sperm? i shot out of a 70-year-old cannon, bro.” i was the only sperm. i had to shut down the nuts. i had to close all the windows, fuckin’ sweep up. on the way out, i passed a skeleton of a sperm wearing a “vote for lyndon b. johnson” button. that’s not an orgasm. that’s musket fire. so when i say i’m happy to be somewhere, i’m just happy to be. anywhere. except at denny’s. they a bunch of child molesters over there. y’all got denny’s here?\n",

            " yep!\n",
            "i don’t have a nice car. i have that car where you act like you don’t remember where you parked, but you’re standing right next to your car. and when nobody’s looking, you fuckin’ get in and you escape. it looks like you’re stealing your own car. you tell your friends it’s a rental. they’re like, “they’re renting ’97 accords to people?” like, “yeah, i’m just driving it for charity, actually, yeah. yeah, every time i floor it, a blind boy can see four seconds. so he gets that pop, you know. so, i get a lot of speeding tickets, you know, for his little dark ass.”\n",
            "no offense, if anybody is blind either. my friend maurice is blind, and he said it ain’t that bad in there. but you gotta have money to get the ladies. if you don’t have money, you gotta have the other money: drugs. especially in l.a., man, that’s where i live now. them girls out there a bunch of coke-ghosts. that’s what i call them. coke-ghosts, baby, ’cause they’re invisible. they don’t answer your calls, your texts, but you break out a little bag of snow-caine, they fuckin’ show up out of thin air. like, “blow! blow!”\n",

            "then i tried yoga. i don’t know if you’ve been to yoga. i don’t know if you’ve been to this deal. okay? if you haven’t been, it’s like… it’s like fuckin’, but by yourself, real slowly. and it’s awkward ’cause all the ladies in there are sweatin’ out of their crotches a little bit. what is the deal, ladies, huh? somethin’ bit you? what happened, huh? what is going on? put a little powder in your pants before you go in there. starch up! starch up, drink a red bull, “g” up! what, you hide an armpit in your crotch? get your life together! huh? huh? wear a cup, we don’t care. just get it together. what if i went around just frothing at the balls all day like i had a little st. bernard living behind my nuts? “get back there, buddy. get back there.” “g” up, ladies. they need to quit marketing yoga to dudes. yoga ain’t for dudes. “hey, bro, want to do a bunch of shit you couldn’t do?” “fuck, no, you creep.”\n",
            "touch my feet. i ain’t touching my feet. that’s why god put ’em down there, so i wouldn’t be messing with ’em, you little sinner. yoga ain’t for dudes, man. if my grandfather walked in on six of his friends stretching at the same time, he’d hit ’em with a fucking shovel, okay? this shit ain’t christian! “you men are stretching and don’t even know each other’s names! what are you doing? look at your life!” then they have some guy who works in the yoga studio. he looks like he got fired from a renaissance fair. he’s like, “you’re doing a great job.” i’m like, “who in the fuck are you?” he’s like, “open your hip.” “i’ll shit on your linoleum. i will shit in here, bro. i shit places, okay? don’t make me make this one of ’em.” yoga ain’t for dudes. you want a yoga class for dudes, here’s the class, all right? it’s called “simon says don’t fart.”\n",
            "that’s the class. it lasts three minutes. every man farts, admits to it, introduces themselves to the other men in the room, looking them square in the eyes, and leaves out of there with christ in his heart. not this other cat factory they’re runnin’. i hate fartin’. i do. i always have. i always have, okay? i just hate it. i just don’t– i can’t believe it, man. can you believe we’re still fartin’? we’re farters. we think we know somethin’? we’re farters. we have air flyin’ out of our ass when it wants to. what the fuck, people? i have an app on my phone that can take my blood pressure, but my asshole’s still livin’ in the wild west. if apple would spend a half hour on our sphincters, we wouldn’t have this problem! bring back jobs! i hate farting, man. it’s like your booty trying to tell everybody all your secrets. it’s like, “don’t smell that, you’ll know everything!”\n",

            "that’s what my brain said. my mouth goes…  right to his face!  like an asian that won’t start.  thankfully he speaks , ’cause he’s been around social roaches like your boy. i gotta open door number two, but i don’t want this interaction to end. we might hug, we might fuck a little. this is hollywood, son. this is my chance with brad-frikkin’-pitt, you animals. so, door number two, okay? naturally, i could just open that door, walk in this building, let this man live his life. or i could open the door for him, let him walk by and just live my own life. but this is what i did. i open the door. as it swings open, i jump across and put my back against the open door. like, a way that people don’t open doors. he looks at me like, “that ain’t how people open doors.” and i said, “i got it, man. i used to work at a door store.” i’m not joking man, i door-stored him. right to his face, dude. right to his brad pitt face. and… and he goes… “ha-ha.” that’s what he said. “ha-ha.”\n",

            "immediately i was gay okay like– poof– gay so i’m walking and he’s walking we’re both going to the same building it’s a true story i don’t even know if brad pitt even walks anymore or if there’s an agreement now between gravity and mother nature and the grace of god where they just amicably move little bradley wherever he needs to go like god has a chessboard with one piece and it’s bradfuckingpitt checkmate life right so i’m walking he’s gliding we’re both going to the same building i’m looking at him and i’m thinking to myself “man that looks like brad pitt” and then my brain goes “‘cause that is brad pitt playboy”\n",
            "part of my brain is black and gets a little ‘hood with the rest of my brain i don’t know what to do now ’cause they don’t teach you what to do when you’re about to meet brad pitt they teach us other things if you’re on fire little buddy stop drop and roll if you’re going to argue with a short man don’t argue with him in a prone position argue with him like this and be ready for his little actions but they don’t teach you how to meet bradfrikkingpitt in bradfrikkingperson right so i’m walking he’s gliding we’re going to the same building me and the only brad pitt god ever made brad pitt and he was wearing– he was wearing everything he had on like a tuxedo and he was on a horseback and he had on furs but like exotic furs animals we’ve never even seen like chimpanebras and alapacakeets and he had lorax coming off his shoulders and he had care bear cuff on his boottops and wrists and… he had no shirt on so he’s coming from that way i’m coming this way double doors on the building we get to the front of this building at the same moment and i’m thinking to myself “i’ll get the door ’cause brad’s done a lot for me”\n",
            "so i grab the door on the left and i pull it you know how some asshole always locks the door on the left that asshole works here okay so i pull it and it’s locked usually you would just open the other door but for some reason i just keep pulling on this locked door like it’s gonna start up and i’ma mow the yard with it right and brad pitt is standing right here the only one that god has and you can feel him when he’s standing somewhere ’cause he’s got this invisible energy comin’ off him ’cause he’s made out of vagina and diamonds so i’m pulling on this door and he goes “you got it man” ‘cause that’s what brad pitt say when shit ain’t going well so i look back at him like this if you ever looked right at him up close it’s like staring directly into the sun but with a little bit of brad pitt in there i look back at him like this and i say “i got it man”\n",
            "that’s what my brain said my mouth goes…  right to his face  like an asian that won’t start  thankfully he speaks  ’cause he’s been around social roaches like your boy i gotta open door number two but i don’t want this interaction to end we might hug we might fuck a little this is hollywood son this is my chance with bradfrikkin’pitt you animals so door number two okay naturally i could just open that door walk in this building let this man live his life or i could open the door for him let him walk by and just live my own life but this is what i did i open the door as it swings open i jump across and put my back against the open door like a way that people don’t open doors he looks at me like “that ain’t how people open doors” and i said “i got it man i used to work at a door store” i’m not joking man i doorstored him right to his face dude right to his brad pitt face and… and he goes… “haha” that’s what he said “haha”\n",
            "and i don’t know if you ever heard him laugh in person but i mean it’s beautiful you don’t even hear it at first you just feel the laughter on your skin when you finally hear his laugh i mean it just… it sounds like a million babies eating cookies at the same time right when i heard his laugh crop circles formed in my hair and memories of making love to a hundred women i never even met starting living in my heart mi corazón so i’m just standing there against this door right people are going in and out i’m just reduced to a concierge by this man this lady comes runnin’ up this straightup street beast and she’s like “did brad pitt just go in there” i was like “no ma’am he went thattaway” you know ‘cause i ain’t telling this bitch where i keep him thank you thank you and the third time i was gay was just a general time when i was younger we used to play a game called “gay chicken” anybody in the navy uh… homosexualis con pollo it’s like you and your buddy stand there hold each other’s penis all right first person to let go is gay but if you get an erection you’re out so you got to play offense and defense bro the worst is when you start catching their pulse a little “why you pump faking homie you pump faking”\n",

girls they could just eat like shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through\\nand then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they don\\u2019t have insomnia yet they don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they don\\u2019t have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it it\\u2019s ok come out already everybody has it if you don\\u2019t have it yet you go and get it you go and get it it\\u2019s coming you don\\u2019t have hpv yet you\\u2019re a fucking loser all right that\\u2019s what that says about you a lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have hpv because it\\u2019s undetectable in men it\\u2019s really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says \\u201cboo\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either i\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of wolverine bitches we\\u2019ll find out\\num i can also tell that i\\u2019m getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library i\\u2019m not interested in books like fifty shades of grey ok i\\u2019m interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes that\\u2019s right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success that\\u2019s what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around i\\u2019m a horrible person i\\u2019m not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help me\\ni have a hoarding problem which i\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems i\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communists\\nthe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments \\u2026 manual the manual she don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is those of you under  probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like \\u201cyou never know when you might need this\\u201d and i was like \\u201cbut\\u2026 i do know\\u2026 that i\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die\\u201d \\u201cand i\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success\\u201d\\ni grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really i\\u2019m the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen they\\u2019re sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me he\\u2019s way out of my league and i saw him and i was like \\u201coh my god who is that\\u201d and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like \\u201coh my god i\\u2019m gonna trap his ass\\u201d \\u201cgoing to trap his ass\\u201d and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like \\u201call right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden\\u201d when really it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to\\u2026 it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had\\u2026 we had so much chemistry he was like \\u201chey wassup\\u201d i was like \\u201cwassup\\u201d and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like \\u201chey can you drop me off\\u201d i was like \\u201cwhere\\u201d he was like \\u201cat the park\\u201d and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like \\u201coh no\\u201d \\u201ci just fucked a homeless dude again\\u201d\\nmy husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory it\\u2019s\\u2026 too much i don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 you feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude you know you feel like you\\u2019re in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very you know it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like i\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know just right there through the money hole and just\\u2026 and then also he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there i\\u2019m like \\u201ci could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer\\u201d you know\\nbut i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you don\\u2019t gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese i\\u2019m halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people it\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing it\\u2019s what love is built on you know\\nmy last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like \\u201chold it you guys aren\\u2019t mexican\\u201d asianamerican men are very underrated i don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them they\\u2019re the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down it\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin oh my god it\\u2019s so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards it\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like \\u201ci did not ask to be exfoliated today\\u201d \\u201cthis is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi\\u201d and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility that\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from\\ni think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because he\\u2019s halffilipino and halfjapanese and i\\u2019m halfchinese and halfvietnamese so we\\u2019re both halffancy asian\\u2026 \\u2026and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases it\\u2019s\\u2026 it\\u2019s different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didn\\u2019t know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like \\u201cit\\u2019s authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp\\u201d i was like \\u201cit\\u2019s not authentic ok\\u201d you can tell first and foremost by the name \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused\\ni grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats that\\u2019s right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so it\\u2019s funny right because he\\u2019s asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean we\\u2019re like \\u201coh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house\\nhim and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition that\\u2019s how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head first passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so you\\u2019re like \\u201ci\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like \\u201cshut the fuck up fine will you marry me\\u201d and then afterwards the woman is always like \\u201coh my god he proposed\\u201d \\u201cit came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something\\u2026 that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day\\u201d let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday\\u2026 because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread that\\u2019s how rotten i was\\npeople are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband i\\u2019m a completely different person you\\u2013 like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him i\\u2019m very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic we\\u2019ve been together now for five years and for five years i\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me \\u2018cause he graduated from harvard business school and i don\\u2019t wanna work anymore i don\\u2019t i straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore i don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future \\u2018cause i don\\u2019t wanna work anymore i\\u2019ve been reading that book by sheryl sandberg she\\u2019s the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i don\\u2019t wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like \\u201cwe\\u2019re dumb women we don\\u2019t know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility\\u201d and then all these women had to show off and be like \\u201cwe could do it we could do anything\\u201d \\u201cbitch shut up\\u201d \\u201cdon\\u2019t tell them the secret\\u201d they ruined it for us and now we\\u2019re expected to work when i hear the phrase \\u201cdoubleincome household\\u201d i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and they\\u2019re like \\u201cbut ali we have so many more options now\\u201d oh you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it\\na lot of my friends when we walk around together they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street and they\\u2019ll be like \\u201clook at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants\\u201d i\\u2019m like \\u201cthat bitch is a genius\\u201d \\u201cshe\\u2019s not a housewife she\\u2019s retired\\u201d\\ni do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is\\u2026 it\\u2019s a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers it\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sadass meal they don\\u2019t gotta do that they don\\u2019t gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole it\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your coworker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and you\\u2019re like \\u201coh no courtney\\u2019s listening she\\u2019s waiting she\\u2019s timing me\\u201d and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the goonies housewives they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit too they don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they don\\u2019t gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they don\\u2019t gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they want\\nyou know it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say \\u201cyou need to get to work on time\\u201d i was like \\u201cyou need to eat bananas\\u201d \\u201ci saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit together\\u201d\\nmy fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like \\u201chey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had\\u201d i was like \\u201cwhy you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that don\\u2019t your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said \\u2018i do\\u2019 what i really meant was

in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools because according to her it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying \\u201cyou\\u2019re bossy\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say \\u201cyou have executive leadership skills\\u201d which is a very roundabout

there\\u2019s\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear that\\u2019s not the case with male comics once they have a baby they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like \\u201cguys i just had this fucking baby that baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit it\\u2019s so annoying and boring\\u201d and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like \\u201cthat\\u2019s hilarious i identify\\u201d and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples

ok we all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack\\u201d well asian don\\u2019t die we don\\u2019t die especially the women we live forever and you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers because

\\u2026i\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god not again\\u201d i need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess there\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me but i\\u2019m still here you know\\ni need to have children to keep me company when i get older it\\u2019s lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis \\u2018cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead i\\u2019m just kidding she doesn\\u2019t have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when i\\u2019m older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore i\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living that\\u2019s not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they don\\u2019t give a fuck they got no shame they\\u2019re like \\u201ci\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park do

protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevity\\ni also decided to have a kid because uh i\\u2019m only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me like i\\u2019m only  and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be it\\u2019s very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just\\u2026 \\u201ci slime you i slime you ghostbusters\\u201d\\ni don\\u2019t know what kind of mother i\\u2019m gonna be i\\u2019m\\u2013 i\\u2019m  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich \\u201cuh mmm\\u201d they watch property brothers scratch \\u201cwhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019 mmm\\u201d every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is \\u201cwhen can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers\\u201d nature made you urgently curious to protect you \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood if it\\u2019s too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmd\\nwhen my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like \\u201coh my god that\\u2019s so hot you guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019\\u201d no dude that\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when you\\u2019re in your  and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019 it tells you when it\\u2019s easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like \\u201cwe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019 i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out it\\u2019s like \\u2018release the kraken\\u201d and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um\\u2026 yeah and most of the time like we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex \\u2019cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and i\\u2019d be like \\u201cok it\\u2019s go time\\u201d and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says \\u201cplease hurry the fuck up\\u201d and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish it\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupidass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just\\u2026 and then because we\\u2019re hippies i\\u2019d be like \\u201chey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok\\u201d and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me that\\u2019s right \\u2018cause i don\\u2019t wanna work anymore\\ni\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that they\\u2019re like \\u201coh my god that\\u2019s so dark and terrible i can\\u2019t believe that\\u201d i\\u2019m  girl when you\\u2019re  you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage it\\u2019s super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 she\\u2019s from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like \\u201cuh yeah where i\\u2019m from that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes it\\u2019s whatevs ok\\u201d and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me \\u201coh my god i see two sacks which means you\\u2019re having twins\\u201d and i was like \\u201cno\\u201d and then she said \\u201cbut what i don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat\\u201d and i was like \\u201cyes\\u201d \\u201cthe lord is mysterious\\u201d don\\u2019t feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds i\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like \\u201cyou look\\u201d \\u201cyou watch the whole thing\\u201d and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist that\\u2019s my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wanted\\ni\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth though i\\u2019m\\u2013 i\\u2019m very very scared of childbirth that\\u2019s why i\\u2019m going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is that\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying \\u201cali did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table\\u201d i was like \\u201cyeah i look forward to it\\u201d i\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work i can\\u2019t wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay that\\u2019s the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house \\u201chey can you wash the dishes\\u201d \\u201cno\\u201d \\u201ccan you water the plants\\u201d \\u201ci am not doing jack shit anymore i\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball ok are you makin\\u2019 a foot i didn\\u2019t think so you change the channel\\u201d\\ni can already see how there\\u2019s like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me \\u201coh my god i can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments he is so supportive\\u201d guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me i\\u2019m the star of the show there\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if i\\u2019m not there but he\\u2019s the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant i\\u2019m a bad mommy\\nyou know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me i\\u2019m fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didn\\u2019t know that i didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like \\u201cyou you you owe me money you\\u201d my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but i\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing it\\nnow that i\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant my pussy\\u2019s all wet again but it\\u2019s different it\\u2019s not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like \\u201cwhy is it different\\u201d and i looked it up and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it that\\u2019s not the same when it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue when it\\u2019s neosporin\\nso you know i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy who\\u2019s like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out he\\u2019s the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enron\\u2019d my ass and now if i don\\u2019t work we die why else do you think i\\u2019m performing seven and a half months

\\u201ctwentyfourhour gambling seven days a week  days a year\\u201d  i\\u2019m sitting there like \\u201cwhy can\\u2019t i stop watching this\\u201d and i started thinking at this point why don\\u2019t they just do that to the slot machines you know gambling\\u2019s already shameless might as well go all the way you walk up to one of the little machines pop in a      \\u201cdon\\u2019t

with a question that\\u2019s not how comedy shows happen but i\\u2019m gonna start it with a question the question is who here tonight has never heard of me up until tonight  five two five okay to those of you the five of you i say \\u201csorry\\u201d i know you got excited you saw the ticket you saw the last name and then i walked out and you\\u2019re like \\u201cenrique got bigger\\u201d  the only reason why i ask who has never seen or heard of me before is because if you have then you know the type of show that i do and you know the type of show that i don\\u2019t do like i\\u2019m not here to tell you who to vote for who not to vote for what shot to take or what baby to get rid of that\\u2019s not for me to say if you\\u2019re already offended you missed the point i\\u2019m telling you what i\\u2019m not gonna do i promise you i am here to entertain not offend okay  we\\u2019re gonna have fun with everybody starting with me but i\\u2019m gonna let you know we\\u2019re living in a different time i\\u2019ve been doing this so long i always figured as long as i\\u2019m being nice i shouldn\\u2019t have any issues but it\\u2019s a very different time this is year  for me\\n\\nyeah twentyseven years of being a comedian and in those  years i never had to worry you know when i first got started shoot\\u2026  i was cleanshaven i had hair i know look at some of you \\u201cwhat happened\\u201d huh vaccine i know i\\u2019m kidding i\\u2019m kid\\u2026 i\\u2019m kidding sorry florida i\\u2019m kidding i\\u2019m kidding i said \\u201cvaccine\\u201d some of you were like \\u201ci told you\\u201d yeah   \\u201ci told you he said so\\u201d   some friends tell me \\u201cdude man you\\u2019re making money now why don\\u2019t you get the hair thingy\\u201d i said \\u201cfor what\\u201d \\u201cwell you know some women they want a guy with hair\\u201d well good for them\\n\\nand they\\u2019re not lying i have gone out with some women that made it a point to tell me that hair was important one told me flat out \\u201ci need to be able to run my fingers through your hair\\u201d yeah and i told her \\u201chey look if you go deep enough\\u2026  \\u2026you\\u2019re gonna get your wish\\u201d \\u201cyou were not specific on location hey\\u201d \\u201cyou want hair you want pelos i got you\\u201d but yeah  years of being a comedian and in those  years i have seen a lot of comedians come and go and i feel very grateful that in all that time we\\u2019ve still managed to maintain a certain level\\n\\nso i feel like we\\u2019re doing something right which feels weird to me because now i feel like you gotta be very mindful okay you gotta be extra mindful like\\u2026 uh  years of being a comedian i finally started hearing people tell me things that i\\u2019ve never heard before i started hearing people tell me things like \\u201chey fluffy i grew up watching you\\u201d  which is an incredible compliment because that doesn\\u2019t just say that you\\u2019re a fan that says that you\\u2019re invested that says that you\\u2019ve been following this career for a very long time some of you the first time you saw me perform you were kids  and now some of you are here tonight with your kids  and so i just want to say thank you for all those years of trust and continuing to come back to see the show it means a lot  hearing someone say they grew up watching me that is one of the most beautiful compliments any entertainer can receive and i understand that now with therapy that that\\u2019s what that means\\n\\nlook i\\u2019m not gonna lie the first time i heard someone tell me that they grew up watching me i didn\\u2019t know how to handle it i didn\\u2019t know how to process because nobody wants to feel like they\\u2019re getting\\u2026 old the first time i heard it i was like\\u2026  second time i heard it i was like \\u201cbuy a hat\\u201d the third time i accepted it i was like  \\u201cmany years ago when i first got started all of this was land as far as the eye could see\\u201d \\u201cit was a very different time and\\u2026\\u201d by the way i don\\u2019t know why my old voice is white  he just is i tried doing the mexican voice but you don\\u2019t take him as serious  \\u201cwell screw you\\u201d \\u201cwe were at the ranch and were told to fuck off dude\\u201d \\u201cit\\u2019s very tough out there\\u201d  but times are changing the rules are changing so i don\\u2019t know how much longer this is gonna be okay i\\u2019ll tell you what happened to me and why i brought that up i did a podcast and before i went into the studio i\\u2019m talking to the producer outside and the producer\\u2019s excited and happy and she\\u2019s like \\u201cgabriel iglesias we\\u2019re so excited to have you\\u201d \\u201cthis is really cool\\u201d \\u201cbefore you go in the host wanted me to ask you something before you go in for your interview\\u201d i go \\u201csure go for it\\u201d \\u201cokay what do you identify as\\u201d  i wasn\\u2019t sure how to answer that i\\u2019m  years old i didn\\u2019t know what to say i was like \\u201cshit hungry i guess\\u201d\\ni mean\\u2026\\n i\\u2019m tired sleepy depressed on tuesdays i don\\u2019t know what you want me to say see here\\u2019s the thing i knew what she was trying to ask me i just wasn\\u2019t trying to get involved in a conversation about something that has absolutely nothing to do with me this was\\u2026 yeah  i felt like i was being baited because no matter how i answered that question i was gonna find myself in an awkward situation so you know because for me i was just like \\u201clet me just be funny\\u201d but nowadays you can\\u2019t just not answer the question because silence is seen as a problem and i\\u2019m sorry if me not answering a certain question is considered a problem i was brought up during a time where you were constantly told to mind your business\\n\\nthat\\u2019s all i\\u2019m trying to do is stay in my lane another thing we were constantly told was always respect your elders  and no matter what generation you were from that was at least the one thing we could always agree on until now now older people are seen as a problem they are you know and i understand the youth of today has the technology in the palm of their hands and you can google just about anything but you cannot google life experience okay you can\\u2019t you can\\u2019t download struggling you can\\u2019t download failure you can\\u2019t download these moments that help build you up to make you a better person and so again for me i chose to stay in my lane and just crack jokes when the girl asked me the question she got very upset she got very offended as soon as i cracked the joke she was like \\u201cno that\\u2019s not what i mean\\u201d \\u201ci mean what are your pronouns\\u201d \\u201cwhat\\u201d \\u201cwhat are your pronouns\\u201d \\u201cfor example are you a they or them\\u201d \\u201ca they\\u201d  \\u201cor a them\\u201d  \\u201chow fat am i\\u201d  \\u201cwhen did i stop being an it\\u201d apparently i ate myself into a plural that\\u2019s what happened\\n\\nwhat i\\u2019m finding is even if you have good intentions and you\\u2019re trying to be cool you can still find yourself in a situation so i\\u2019ll tell you what else happened to me m\\u2019kay i was at a mcdonald\\u2019s  that\\u2019s not even the joke but okay  all righty they\\u2019re like \\u201chere this is gonna be good\\u201d no no i was at a mcdonald\\u2019s by my house the mcdonald\\u2019s by my house is actually a twofer it\\u2019s a mcdonald\\u2019s on the corner and it\\u2019s also a gas station i got a big suv i knew it was gonna be a minute so i said \\u201clet me go get some nuggets while i\\u2019m here\\u201d i walk into the mcdonald\\u2019s and as i\\u2019m walking in i couldn\\u2019t help but notice this homeless family sitting right outside now they didn\\u2019t have a sign they did not ask me for money but you could just tell you could just tell that this poor family is dealing with life so i get inside and i said \\u201cyou know what\\u201d \\u201ci don\\u2019t

i\\u2019m not a dick that\\u2019s why i didn\\u2019t correct her  that\\u2019s what i mean you guys even if you have good intentions nowadays people can take what you\\u2019re saying or doing and twist it to make you look bad there should be no consequences for being kind for trying to help for wanting to do the right thing for caring unfortunately we\\u2019re still consumed by this word called \\u201cliability\\u201d that sometimes we forget to be a little human and that\\u2019s unfortunate i\\u2019m not trying to get on a soapbox about this i\\u2019m trying to let you know some things i\\u2019ve been dealing with and i\\u2019m just here to report  the thing with me now is that after  years of being a comedian every time i walk out the door the light is officially on in the sense that every time i leave my house there is a slight chance i could make the news for example did martin talk about how uh he fell off the stage earlier in the show\\n yeah\\nokay okay cool uh for the home audience martin he fell a while back he talked about it i know you didn\\u2019t see it \\u2019cause your subscription only covers so much\\num yeah\\n you can watch the first half on prime i think it\\u2019s on prime maybe you can just see it there then come back and check out the rest so long story short we were doing a show in phoenix arizona and martin accidentally fell off of a stage this high and he broke his foot now the incredible part about martin is that he got up and on adrenaline ran around got back up on stage and performed and then was taken to the hospital after he walked off stage he is a professional  seriously that is a pro much respect \\u2019cause if it would have been me\\u2026  if i would\\u2019ve fallen off stage and the staff was like \\u201cwhat about the fans\\u201d \\u201cwell bye felicia\\u201d  \\u201cwhat do we tell \\u2019em\\u201d \\u201crefund\\u201d  but see the difference is martin had to tell you he fell for you to know he fell and by the way i saw the fall i saw he came out and just kind of tripped over a cord backstage came through the curtain already you know and then you know\\u2026 \\u201cmartiiin\\u201d  women in the front row were like \\u201che fell for me\\u201d  i\\u2019m glad you laughed i said that last night and some guy was like \\u201caw\\u201d  i said \\u201cwhy \\u2018aww\\u2019\\u201d  \\u201cwell that\\u2019s your friend\\u201d  \\u201cexactly that\\u2019s why i make fun of him\\u201d that is the mark of a true friendship is being able to say real evil things about each other  because you know you don\\u2019t really mean it plus you don\\u2019t think that if i would\\u2019ve fallen off the stage instead of martin that he wouldn\\u2019t\\u2019ve had a joke you better believe he would have had a joke he would have told people \\u201ci saw fluffy bounce\\u201d\\n\\nnot to mention the fact that you know that\\u2019ll make the news i fall off the stage tonight there\\u2019ll be a van out in front in an hour \\u201cwe\\u2019re standing here live in front of the hard rock hotel and casino where authorities believe fluffy lost control\\u201d \\u201clet\\u2019s go to tom who\\u2019s inside the venue who can fill us in with more\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s right jim i\\u2019m standing here at the hard rock hotel and casino inside the venue where apparently fluffy took a spill\\u201d \\u201cit is still uncertain as to what happened here tonight\\u201d \\u201cwe did have a chance to interview local authorities who had this to say\\u201d \\u201cdamn\\u201d  \\u201cit is still uncertain if there was any problems with the stage\\u201d \\u201cwe did speak to security who had this to comment\\u201d \\u201ci saw the whole damn thing okay\\u201d \\u201cwhoo fluffy fell he fell hard\\u201d \\u201ci ain\\u2019t seen that many white people cry since a taylor swift concert\\u201d \\u201cit was bad it was bad and in miami are you kidding me\\u201d \\u201che hurt more cubans than castro\\u201d  and that\\u2019s how you get canceled so uh that\\u2019s the point i\\u2019m trying to make here i made the news recently uh without giving too much away there\\u2019s an episode of family feud coming out very soon that i\\u2019m gonna be on yeah\\n\\nit is the celebrity edition so it\\u2019s fluffy and fluffy\\u2019s family versus fat joe\\u2026  \\u2026and his family so yeah it\\u2019s fat joe versus fluffy because apparently the producers have a great sense of humor  long story short i flew in some family from the east coast to be on the show the show went over very well you\\u2019ll find out who wins later here\\u2019s the deal the next day my sister who was one of the people i flew in she hadn\\u2019t been in california in forever and she was like \\u201ccan we go to disneyland\\u201d and i\\u2019m like \\u201csure let\\u2019s go\\u201d so it was her and her husband gordy and i took them to disney and we get on a couple of rides and just so we\\u2019re clear that\\u2019s not what made the news  i said that last night someone was like \\u201c\\u2018cause he fit\\u201d no\\n\\nsome people right yeah we get on the cars ride at california adventure and halfway through the cars ride the car\\u2026  \\u2026stops on the track and my sister looked at me she goes \\u201cis this supposed to happen\\u201d i go \\u201cno the check cleared we\\u2019re supposed to finish this is uh\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cwe paid it\\u2019s supposed to work no this\\u2026\\u201d it took the disney people about  minutes to come get us and take us out of the car so we\\u2019re sitting there outside in the sun for  minutes i had no problem with that because i am mocha i\\u2019m okay in the sun for  minutes my sister she\\u2019s twice as dark as me she\\u2019s like freaking you know apache she\\u2019s\\u2026 you know freaking azteca  just you know\\u2026 her husband on the other hand he\\u2019s from minnesota  he almost died\\n\\n\\u201coh don\\u2019 cha know\\u201d yeah so\\u2026 while we\\u2019re sitting there in the car waiting for the disney people to come take us out of the car the people waiting in line realize that the ride has been shut down and so from the ride you can see the line people see the car on the track and then they see who\\u2019s in the car  and all of a sudden cell phones start comin\\u2019 out and by the time we left disney tmz had already reported the story and you can google this okay tmz reported the story before we left the park it said \\u201cfluffy stuck on la freeway at disney\\u201d  i thought it was cute i thought it was silly i thought it was funny i thought it was okay until i read the comments  oh some of you\\u2026 are dicks  one lady wrote \\u201cjust \\u2019cause you\\u2019re tall enough to ride doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re small enough to fit\\u201d\\n\\na guy wrote \\u201cthe car got tired\\u201d  another guy wrote \\u201cyou\\u2019re mexican couldn\\u2019t you fix it\\u201d  and that was martin yeah so\\u2026   anyway so\\u2026 the time before that we made world news some of you might remember this story the guys and i were involved in an emergency landing situation i had uh chartered a private jet because my last netflix special the money finally hit my account and i you know freakin\\u2019\\u2026 i thought i was y\\u2019know ballin\\u2019 right nope turns out we were fallin\\u2019 worst turbulence we have ever experienced in  years of being comedians uh worst turbulence i ever felt for sure at one point the jet did this\\n\\n i did this\\n\\n the scariest part was watching my dogs leave the seat fortunately we landed safely we were okay that\\u2019s not what made the news what made the news is that when we came in for the landing the jet touched down and then it skid off the runway by  yards and we ended up in a field a field a field are you kidding me as hard as i work\\u2026   \\u2026to break stereotypes  a bunch of mexicans ended up in a field yeah that\\u2019s what happened\\n\\nthat\\u2019s how tmz reported it \\u201cmexicans found in field\\u201d  in the movies the pilots are always the first to know when there\\u2019s an issue and in the movies the pilots always have the courtesy of telling the passengers they love to hear themselves talk they get on the mic \\u201call right it\\u2019s your captain speaking here\\u201d \\u201ci just want to let you know we\\u2019ll be experiencing rough air\\u201d \\u201cif you could just fasten your seatbelts we\\u2019re gonna be aokay all right\\u2026\\u201d  you know if it gets bumpy you know

just a few seconds\\u2026\\u201d  if the plane\\u2019s going down \\u201cbrace for impact\\u201d \\u201chold on tight we\\u2019re comin\\u2019 in hot\\u201d our pilot\\u2026 nada\\n\\nour pilot didn\\u2019t say anything until we came to like a complete stop and then maybe like a minute later the cockpit door opened up and he stuck his head in and he\\u2019s like \\u201cyou good\\u201d  i was like \\u201cmy chihuahua\\u2019s in a cup holder i am not good\\u201d it was a scary situation you guys but let me tell you even though we were involved in an emergency landing and we thought we were gonna die i\\u2019m grateful for the experience believe it or not i\\u2019m grateful because it reminded me how valuable life is and how quickly things can change\\n\\nevery now and then we need a little reminder we need to get shaken up a little to remind ourselves \\u201coh my god this is special\\u201d \\u201cthis is important enjoy it have fun\\u201d the rest of the day after the landing there was nothing anybody could tell me to ruin how good i felt to just be breathing and be alive nothing  and so that\\u2019s why i uh\\u2026 i\\u2019m grateful for bad moments and i think bad moments are actually a good thing because we need balance in life you need to have bad experiences in order to truly appreciate good experiences not every day can be the same  you need to have a way to ba\\u2013 now don\\u2019t get me wrong sometimes there\\u2019s too many bad days in a row that shit sucks and that\\u2019s actually what happened to me after the neardeath experience i go home i go home to find out that someone broke into my house  yeah yeah i\\u2019m like \\u201care you kidding me\\u201d \\u201cthat\\u2019s why i survived to see this shit\\u201d  the only reason why you haven\\u2019t heard about it until now is because the detective who\\u2019s working the case told me i\\u2019m not allowed to talk about it in california\\n\\nyeah if the guys that broke into my house are here tonight\\u2026  \\u2026bravo  bravo that\\u2019s a flex and a half no they broke into my house and of course the number one question is \\u201cwhat did they take from your house\\u201d and what they took from me honestly it was my peace of mind i didn\\u2019t feel safe in that house after uh but if you must know i did everything to prevent a breakin i had first of all a good neighborhood i had an alarm i had two camera systems i had a fence that surrounded the property i thought i was good um i got video footage of the entire robbery\\n\\nin   oh that shit is crisp i saw the guys that broke in but i could not identify them because they were wearing masks all i can tell you about the two guys that broke into my house is that they were  years old i know they were  because when they jumped the fence and hit the ground no pain\\n\\nif that would\\u2019ve been a  with messedup sciatica he\\u2019d have thought twice about that fence so they jumped the fence went in the backyard and they broke the window and got in through the kitchen they trashed my house okay every drawer open every cabinet open everything got pulled out onto the floor so they could sift uh\\u2026 couches were flipped over cushions were thrown down and they pulled every single frame off the wall and i asked the detective i said \\u201chey look i understand the drawers the cabinets and even the couch thing\\u201d \\u201cbut what\\u2019s the story with the frames on the wall\\u201d \\u201cwhy did they take everything off the wall but didn\\u2019t take any frames\\u201d \\u201csome of that stuff was art\\u201d  \\u201cmr iglesias you have to understand something about these people that broke into your home\\u201d \\u201cthey were not looking for photos or art\\u201d \\u201cthey were actually looking for a safe\\u201d i said \\u201ca safe\\u201d  \\u201cyes sir a safe\\u201d \\u201ca lot of times in these homes people will put a hole in the wall install a safe and then they\\u2019ll hang a frame over the safe to disguise that their valuables are in there\\u201d i said \\u201ca safe\\u201d\\n\\n \\u201csir yes a safe\\u201d  \\u201cbut i just got this money\\u201d  \\u201cdid they check the mattress\\u201d   \\u201cdon\\u2019t know\\u201d  \\u201clet\\u2019s find out\\u201d so we walk into the master bedroom i grab the edge of the bed right and i picked it up and i was like \\u201cah stupid\\u201d  \\u201cit\\u2019s all here\\u201d oh my god these guys had no idea they were robbing somebody more ghetto than them  so at the end of it they only got a couple of little trinkets from the drawers um and that\\u2019s pretty much it they made a mess of the house they didn\\u2019t get any of the money i\\u2019ll tell you what they did get they got my guns  now\\u2026 i have never been open about the fact that i am in fact a registered gun owner\\n\\nrelax florida  i\\u2019ve never been open about it because quite frankly it\\u2019s nobody\\u2019s business okay however it does pertain to the story that i\\u2019m about to share with you um i am a recent gun owner i became a gun owner in  m\\u2019kay uh yeah when we were in the middle of\\u2026  \\u2026it  every morning watching the news we didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen and it started to feel irresponsible not preparing myself for a worstcase situation every morning watching the news it felt like we were headed towards the purge  some of you are laughing but think about this the purge would have taken less time  yeah the purge that\\u2019s how they should\\u2019ve woke us up at least for entertainment purposes   \\u201ci\\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in the pandemic\\u201d \\u201cthe local time is  am\\u201d \\n\\nfear is why i decided to buy a gun i was afraid and i got no problem saying that i was scared we didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen um it\\u2019s only for protection i don\\u2019t hunt i don\\u2019t want to hunt i don\\u2019t need to i know where there\\u2019s three chickfilas  i\\u2019m good i don\\u2019t go out on the weekends you know pull  there\\u2019s no\\u2026  i still own a nintendo i don\\u2019t need that shit fear is the only reason why i decided to buy a gun so i wound up at this sporting goods store right by my house i walk in there and this place is packed full of people that normally would not have been open to the idea of owning a gun but they felt like me they were scared and rightfully so i kept hearing the same conversation over and over and over i kept hearing this\\u2026 \\u201ci would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it\\u201d   and i don\\u2019t care where you\\u2019re from that makes a lot of sense and i was not about to let politics interfere with my personal safety so next thing you know\\u2026  so next thing you know i got in line i had to get a ticket with a number like when you\\u2019re at the dmv or meat market  the butcher shop the bodega \\u201cnumber

rifles\\u2026  \\u2026and four handguns and a case\\u2026 a case of spreader ammunition  i hear some of you clapping and why it\\u2019s excessive i only have two hands  see i feel again even though my home was burglarized i feel grateful because i wasn\\u2019t there and i had my dogs with me i can\\u2019t replace my dogs i can\\u2019t replace me  stuff is stuff however if i would have been home i would have done whatever i needed to do that\\u2019s the difference in this situation there\\u2019s two kinds of people one people like me had the guns had the ammo glad they weren\\u2019t there but if they were there they would\\u2019ve done something about it \\u2018cause if i was in bed and i heard the\\u2026  \\u2026i would\\u2019ve jumped up  i would\\u2019ve grabbed my gun  i would\\u2019ve ran out into the living room with no shirt on and one sock off\\n\\ni\\u2019d have confronted the person \\u201cfreeze\\u201d knowing my luck\\u2026   \\u201cfluffy\\u201d  \\u201ci said freeze\\u201d  \\u201coh you\\u2019re funny you\\u2019re funny bro\\u201d \\u201cyou\\u2019re funny\\u201d  \\u201cget on the ground\\u201d  \\u201coh\\u201d  \\u201cdon\\u2019t make me shoot you\\u201d  \\u201cah hey\\u201d  \\u201chey beto get in here get in here you\\u2019ll never guess whose house this is\\u201d the other guy runs in  \\u201coh hey oh hey oh hey oh hey\\u201d \\u201ci grew up watching you\\u201d  next thing you know i\\u2019m autographing things they\\u2019re about to take      so like i said in this situation i feel like there\\u2019s two kinds of people one people like me had the guns had the ammunition glad they weren\\u2019t home but if they would have been home they would have done something about it that\\u2019s one type of people the other kind of people are the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to\\u2026\\n\\noh good you\\u2019re here  the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to confront an intruder because you know you have way more guns and ammunition than they do and you are prepared for war  the kind of people who sit home at night in the living room in the dark holding their gun\\n\\n they leave the front door unlocked to make it easier  and people like that always have a friend either across the street or across town \\u201chow is everything over there on your side\\u201d  \\u201cit\\u2019s all clear over here how about you\\u201d \\u201cyeah coast is clear tenfour out\\u201d there this situation the breakin left me traumatized i couldn\\u2019t go back to living in the house because i didn\\u2019t feel safe it\\u2019s just me and two chihuahuas yeah that\\u2019s it i\\u2019m no longer with my son\\u2019s mom and my son lives with his mom so you know\\u2026 and by the way i told my son frankie what happened about the breakin and right away right away \\u201coh really they\\u2019re lucky i wasn\\u2019t there\\u201d  i\\u2019m like \\u201cc\\u00e1lmate john wick\\u201d  \\u201cthey would\\u2019ve kidnapped you\\u201d \\u201ci would\\u2019ve had to pay double to get you back\\u201d i could not go back to living at the house again it\\u2019s just me so i put the house up for sale uh yeah i just couldn\\u2019t and it was a big beautiful home that you guys helped pay for thank you  it was nice real nice freaking four bathrooms four bathrooms yeah one penis\\n\\neven if i ran i couldn\\u2019t you know\\u2026 i put the house up for sale and here\\u2019s the dilemma that i faced i put it up for sale before i had a new place to live because i figured i\\u2019m on the road i\\u2019m always in a tour bus a plane a hotel always somewhere i\\u2019m on the go i was just trying to get ahead of it because when i first bought the house it was sitting on the market for almost two years so i thought i had time what happened was it sold like that because i had two people bidding on the house at the same time and they kept driving up the price and one of the people trying to buy the house he wanted all of my furniture and so my agent for the house goes \\u201cgabriel this is crazy\\u201d \\u201cthese two guys are bidding on your house and they want to give you way more than what you\\u2019re asking\\u201d \\u201cone of them wants to give you an extra  for all of your furniture\\u201d \\u201ci suggest you take it\\u201d and so i did i sold the house with everything except the

better relationships better friendships better people in my life that\\u2019s what i want more than anything else i announced in my last special at dodger stadium that i was no longer in a relationship and i thought that was the best place to announce that because i\\u2019ve been very open about my life my whole show is my life people kept asking about her so i thought that was the best place to announce that you know what happens when you tell  people at a stadium that you\\u2019re single and then netflix airs that around the world i received thousands of \\u201capplications\\u201d for the fluffy fulfillment center yes i did   that\\u2019s right netflix fluffy is hoein\\u2019 out  it was incredible it was exciting it was overwhelming and it was terrifying because i didn\\u2019t know what they wanted um well i\\u2019m gonna tell you that since announcing that i was single i\\u2019ve gone out on a few dates and uh yeah i don\\u2019t want to say how many \\u2019cause i

mean \\u201cboo\\u201d the fact that i\\u2019m being honest about that i don\\u2019t want to be in a relationship i think there\\u2019s something to be said about that i could easily lie meet someone

many couples over the years i\\u2019ve met  couples  couples  couples  couples i met one \\n\\nyeah yeah i call them unicorns i\\u2019ll tell you the story i was in savannah georgia and i had just finished filming the second magic mike movie now\\u2026 yeah i know for those of you that don\\u2019t know i was in magic mike  yes i know i was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked  magic mike not tragic mike so let\\u2019s remember that okay i was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked so um\\u2026 here\\u2019s the thing after the movie after we wrapped my manager joe tells me he says \\u201cdude man\\u201d \\u201ccongratulations on another project\\u201d \\u201ci want to take you out for a steak dinner\\u201d i said \\u201clet\\u2019s go\\u201d so he takes me to this restaurant called ruth\\u2019s chris steak house now very popular chain around the country we go there we sit down and here comes the server and the server\\u2019s real bubbly \\u201chey guys what\\u2019s going on are we celebrating anything today\\u201d \\u201cactually yes we are\\u201d \\u201cwell guess what you\\u2019re not the only ones\\u201d \\u201cyou see that couple over there\\u201d \\u201cthat

thing but the man made it a point to say  years\\u201d \\u201ci thought that was pretty impressive\\u201d i go \\u201cno it is\\u201d so he leaves to go get us some sodas and some bread and i tell my manager i said \\u201chey joe listen\\u201d \\u201ci\\u2019mma go say hi to the couple real quick\\u201d  \\u201cdon\\u2019t get us kicked out\\u201d  \\u201ci\\u2019m not gonna\\u201d  \\u201cdon\\u2019t make it like last time\\u201d  \\u201cit\\u2019s not gonna be\\u201d so i get up and i push in my chair and i make my way over to the couple now i understand how important this night is for them i know exactly how long it took to get to that point and i am not trying to mess that up but i have questions  and these two people are clearly professionals in that department so i approached the table as tactfully as i could and i said \\u201cpardon the interruption\\u201d \\u201cit has come to my attention that we are celebrating  years of marriage\\u201d and the man was so happy that someone acknowledged that he was just thrilled he\\u2019s like\\u2026   \\u201cthat\\u2019s right son\\u201d \\u201cfiftyfive years ago today this lovely lady sittin\\u2019 next to me right here said i do and we\\u2019ve been together ever since\\u201d  \\u201cthat is beautiful\\u201d \\u201cmay i ask you a question\\u201d  \\u201cabsolutely\\u201d  \\u201chow come you\\u2019re not

thing or two\\u201d uh uh\\u2026 \\u201cwe have children grandchildren greatgrandchildren\\u201d \\u201cwe have traveled this great big world of ours many times over\\u201d \\u201cwe\\u2019re both

the worst in people as well\\u201d \\u201cwe have had just about every type of conversation there is to have  at least twice  and after  years of marriage well hell we\\u2019re just trying to enjoy each other\\u2019s company even if it\\u2019s in silence\\u201d i said \\u201cyou\\u2019ve had every type of conversation there is to have\\u201d and i guess i triggered him because he was like

say\\u201d\\n so i took a step towards them i grab my shirt and i flash them  and then i walked away and you know what happened next they started talking  i gave that couple the greatest gift they will never ever acknowledge something new something spontaneous something outrageous something neither one of them had ever seen before i gave them a new story i promise you every year moving forward all they\\u2019re gonna talk about is what happened at   \\u201cremember honey remember when that samoan flashed us\\u201d  right \\u2018cause i\\u2019m a giver i remember many many years ago before there was a venue like this to perform in the only place around here for comedians to do shows was at a comedy club right outside these doors that was part of the original layout of the casino  it was a club called the improv there\\u2019s a chain all over  and you know many many years ago before all of this that\\u2019s where martin and myself my buddy alfred we\\u2019d go do shows at the\\u2026 at the club and the first time we got a chance to perform there i didn\\u2019t really have a name i wasn\\u2019t really established yet and i want to take this moment to acknowledge and thank one person who was super super helpful in that a man by the name of dj laz\\n\\nthat\\u2019s right people the pimp with the limp oh yeah pap\\u00e1 yeah \\u201cit\\u2019s your boy dj laz\\u201d i love him man he\\u2019s great he\\u2019s awesome but yeah he walks in circles he does he walks in circles nice guy dj laz was one of the first people to allow me to be on morning radio with him and he helped promote my shows not only would he allow me to go on his show and promote my shows he would come to my shows and he would bring people and he\\u2019d watch and he\\u2019d sit and hang out and laugh the man has a million things he can do in miami but he\\u2019d come watch my show and then the next day \\u201cpap\\u00e1 come on the radio with me\\u201d \\u201cwe\\u2019re gonna talk about your show\\u201d and he would help me sell out these shows year after year after year so laz i know you\\u2019re watching pap\\u00e1 thank you this is part of you pap\\u00e1 muchas gracias thank you thank you but that was many years down the line in the beginning the first time i performed at that comedy club right outside these doors that\\u2019s no longer there\\u2026 um i\\u2019m talking to the marketing person now keep in mind this is so long ago there was no social media there was no tiktok no freaking twitter no facebook none of that the only way you could promote yourself back then was you had to get on morning radio morning news have somebody do a writeup on you in the newspaper remember those yeah and then of course wordofmouth which is always the best uh they had posters at the comedy club and so the marketing guy goes \\u201cgabriel\\u201d \\u201chelp me help you help us\\u201d \\u201cwe want to sell tickets how do you want to be promoted\\u201d i said \\u201cwell\\u2026\\u201d keep in mind long time ago i said \\u201cum this is how i want you to promote my show\\u201d \\u201cplease use a photo\\u201d \\u201cunder the photo put my name gabriel iglesias\\u201d i didn\\u2019t have the nickname fluffy yet that\\u2019s how long ago this was i said \\u201cunderneath that please put \\u2018as seen on comedy central\\u201d because at the time that was the only television credit i had so the marketing guy goes \\u201cwell i was thinking what about \\u2018gabriel iglesias and his amigos\\u2019\\u201d  \\u201c\\u2018amigos\\u2019\\u201d \\u201cwhy \\u2018amigos\\u2019\\u201d \\u201cbecause i have other mexicans with me\\u201d and he looked at me and said \\u201cgood you get it\\u201d\\n\\n \\u201ci don\\u2019t like that what about \\u2018gabriel iglesias and friends\\u2019\\u201d \\u201cwell we want to put a couple of buzzwords out there to let the community know what type of show it is\\u201d i said \\u201cwhat type of show is it\\u201d  \\u201cit\\u2019s a special show\\u201d  \\u201ci don\\u2019t feel special\\u201d  \\u201cgabriel hear me out what about like a taco tuesday\\u201d  \\u201ci don\\u2019t like it\\u201d  \\u201cokay what about salsa night\\u201d  \\u201csalsa night\\u201d \\u201cwait like dancing or chips and guac\\u201d  \\u201ceither one i don\\u2019t like it\\u201d i could not believe i was having this conversation and i wanted to get upset i wanted to go off on this guy for trying to make me feel like less of a person right but i didn\\u2019t because i knew that if i went off on them i would have been seen as difficult i would have been seen as a problem and i would not have been given another opportunity to come back when people ask me \\u201cwhat do you credit for your success\\u201d of course talent showing up doing what you gotta do but one word that gets left out a lot is the word \\u201csacrifice\\u201d i had to sacrifice something that day and a lot of people think they know what sacrifice means but honestly until you have to make one i don\\u2019t think you do i had to sacrifice my pride because as much as i wanted to go off on this guy i knew that if i did i\\u2019d be shooting myself in the foot i knew that if they could see what i could do on that stage they\\u2019d have to bring me back and they\\u2019d have to treat me different\\n\\nso as much as it hurt as much as it sucked i allowed that stupid taco tuesday to happen so for me i was very upset i was wondering is this something that happens to all new comedians or was i being singled out it was killing me i needed to know i couldn\\u2019t just take out my phone and google it because that wasn\\u2019t an option all those years back so what i had to do was i had to go to the front door of the club where they had a bin and the bin had flyers in it so i grabbed the flyer and i looked at it and the flyer had the list of upcoming comedy shows and i was so upset when i saw it because all it was was pictures names and television credits no silly names no theme nights no \\u201cspicy this\\u201d or \\u201ccrazy that\\u201d just comedy so i said \\u201cwhy are they doing this stupid taco tuesday thing to me\\u201d so i said \\u201clet me try to find another comedian who\\u2019s a little bit more in my vein\\u201d if you know what i mean the only other comedian i could find was a man by the name of george lopez\\n\\nwith george\\u2019s promo however it was just a picture name and underneath that a television credit that said \\u201cas seen on abc\\u201d that\\u2019s it it didn\\u2019t say \\u201clikes to ride a donkey george lopez\\u201d \\u201ceats a burrito with both hands george lopez\\u201d \\u201cay ay ay i just jumped the wall it\\u2019s george lopez\\u201d no so i said \\u201cwhy are they doing this to me\\u201d so then i said \\u201call right all right\\u201d \\u201clet me see how they promote the black comedians\\u201d and with the black comedians it was the same thing picture name television credit and that\\u2019s it unless it was a show that had multiple black comedians on it because if the comedy club had a show with three or more black comics on it they would put a catchy name to it they would call the show \\u201curban night\\u201d or \\u201capollo night\\u201d or \\u201cdef jam comedy night\\u201d \\u201cbet comedy night\\u201d \\u201cblackish comedy night\\u201d but that\\u2019s as far as they would go they wouldn\\u2019t go to the next level like they would for me oh yeah there was no \\u201cmargarita monday\\u201d or \\u201ctaco tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cwetback wednesday\\u201d or \\u201ctortilla thursday\\u201d or \\u201cfiesta friday\\u201d or \\u201cs\\u00e1bado gigante\\u201d no that would never happen to black people are you kidding me you\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cmalt liquor monday\\u201d or \\u201ctupac tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cwatermelon wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cthong ththong thong thursday\\u201d or \\u201cfried chicken friday\\u201d or \\u201csookiesookie saturday\\u201d or \\u201cslapaho sunday\\u201d\\n\\nand that most definitely will not happen to white people     oh i\\u2019mma do the joke and you know why you can laugh and enjoy and not feel threatened by what i\\u2019m about to say because like what i said earlier tonight i am here to entertain i am not here to offend i\\u2019m here to have fun with everybody starting with me plus it\\u2019ll never happen you\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cmonster truck monday\\u201d or \\u201ctrailer park tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cwhite trash wednesday\\u201d or \\u201ctake your sister out thursday\\u201d   \\u201coh hell no fluffy you done crossed the line now\\u201d \\u201cmy name is dustin and i don\\u2019t play that

ago we\\u2019re performing at this bar in montebello california and uh you had to fight with the crowd you had to fight because there was noise there were tvs on people were drinking smoking\\u2026 people were doing everything in there but paying attention so you had to come out quick trying to get them to laugh and one night this comedian pulls me aside and he goes \\u201chey kid\\u201d and when he called me kid i got upset i\\u2019m like \\u201ci could drink\\u201d\\n\\ni was   years old and you know even though i thought i was grown i wasn\\u2019t i wasn\\u2019t grown uh i got upset that he pulled me aside he goes \\u201ccan i give you some advice\\u201d i\\u2019m like \\u201cwho does this guy think he is i\\u2019m funnier than him\\u201d that\\u2019s what i thought because at the age of  i was a punk i really was and so i don\\u2019t know what got into me where i said \\u201csure i\\u2019ll hear you out\\u201d and i just stood there and he said \\u201clisten\\u201d \\u201cum you\\u2019re really likeable on stage and that\\u2019s rare\\u201d \\u201ci\\u2019m gonna give you a bit of advice\\u201d \\u201cif you cut all the cussing out of your show and start taking the filthy material out i think you\\u2019re gonna have a long career ahead of you\\u201d and i know i said \\u201ctake the cussing out\\u201d and i\\u2026 i said the fword twice tonight  technically no three times i said it three times um but i\\u2019m mindful of it i\\u2019m keeping count it\\u2019s not every other word plus we\\u2019re in a casino  okay no one loses their ass and says \\u201caw shucks\\u201d no\\n\\ni heard some of you cussing before \\u201cwhen the fuck is this gonna start\\u201d yeah i heard you i heard you  i\\u2019m fat not deaf  i heard you goddammit so anyway he gives me this advice cut the cussing out of your show take out the filthy material and i don\\u2019t know why i listen but i did and he was absolutely right all of a sudden i started getting opportunities left and right i started getting booked at colleges high schools churches fairs and then the big one casinos   back in the day you had to be squeakyclean to perform at a casino uh but that\\u2019s not the case anymore if you can sell tickets it doesn\\u2019t matter what you do they want to book you but back in the day there was only a few people who could pull it off i was fortunate to be one of those people so i remember i got booked to perform at a casino called morongo in southern california and i\\u2019m backstage with the booker the lady that hired me for the function and she goes \\u201cso no cussing right\\u201d i go \\u201cno no cussing\\u201d  \\u201cno filthy material\\u201d  \\u201cno filthy material\\u201d  \\u201cgood luck\\u201d and it was just me i didn\\u2019t have openers it was just me it was a voiceover on the frickin\\u2019 speaker right \\u201cladies and gentlemen please welcome comedian funny man gabriel iglesias\\u201d and then i just\\u2026 i walked out there right i offended the entire audience\\u2026  \\u2026in five seconds and i did it without cussing frickin\\u2019  kid goes up on stage looks at the crowd and says \\u201chey everybody is this a regular casino or is this an indian casino\\u201d  you see how you all know\\n\\ni didn\\u2019t know i didn\\u2019t know because i didn\\u2019t have tiktok to teach me  what i did have was a life experience that i\\u2019ll never forget as soon as i said that the entire front row which comprised of the tribal members from the casino they all stood up and one of them called me out in front of the entire audience \\u201chey hey you don\\u2019t say that anymore\\u201d \\u201cthe proper term is native american\\u201d \\u201cplease show respect\\u201d and i was like \\u201coh my god i\\u2019m so sorry i didn\\u2019t know\\u201d and i felt horrible and i was so embarrassed fortunately i had a second show at ten o\\u2019clock ten o\\u2019clock hits i take the stage i didn\\u2019t need to be told a thousand times that i messed up that one time of me getting shamed in front of the entire audience was all i needed that\\u2019s why i\\u2019m a firm believer in shaming  i think shaming is good shaming is good as long as you shame with purpose if you\\u2019re about to teach someone a valuable lesson i say go for it because it worked for me i got shamed one time second show ten o\\u2019clock i took the stage ooh it was different i was like \\u201cbefore i get started ladies and gentlemen i\\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the native americans who are here tonight\\u201d \\u201cthank you for this opportunity to perform in your casino\\u201d \\u201ci hope you enjoy the performance\\u201d  i thought i was good all of a sudden another tribal member in the back jumped up and he\\u2019s like \\u201chey drop the \\u2018american\\u2019 just say \\u2018native\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\n \\u201c\\u2018kay\\u201d  that stayed with me that was powerful that was scary next time i did a casino first thing i said was \\u201ci would like to acknowledge all of the natives who are here tonight\\u201d and then someone yelled out \\u201cwe\\u2019re indigenous\\u201d fuck me that\\u2019s four   with time i got a chance to perform all across the united states and then i get my firstever show in canada ironically enough at a casino  it\\u2019s a casino we still perform at called caesars in the city of windsor ontario right across the water from detroit michigan  i come to find out the hard way that in canada it is a completely different term for describing the\\u2026 people\\u2026  \\u2026originally from that land the proper term in canada is actually \\u201cfirst nation\\u201d i didn\\u2019t know that i was so nervous being in canada i said \\u201cnative american\\u201d  like \\u201chello\\u201d i\\u2019m not even in america right frickin\\u2019 stupid right pendejo i know  fortunately someone pulled me to the side and they told me what was up i was lucky that i had a second show ten o\\u2019clock i take the stage and i\\u2019m like \\u201cbefore i begin i would like to acknowledge all of the first nation people who are here tonight\\u201d then some guy yells out \\u201ccall us indians\\u201d  this guy in the front row was like\\u2026  \\u201cthey\\u2019re not indian\\u201d\\n\\n \\u201cthey are not indian\\u201d  canada has always been an adventure there was one show that we did at the same casino anytime now we perform outside of the united states even if it\\u2019s next door in canada or mexico martin\\u2019s first question to the audience is \\u201cdo we have any americans in the house tonight\\u201d because no matter where we perform in the world there\\u2019s always a handful so that night martin takes the stage and he asked the question \\u201cdo we have any americans here tonight\\u201d not knowing that earlier in the day at that same casino in the grand ballroom there was a\\u2026 a endofyear holiday party from an american company from right across the water in detroit and they were having this endofyear celebration and they were there pregaming since noon  partying it up and i guess the\\u2026 the party planner for the event thought it would be an amazing idea to end their party with laughter so this person bought all of the tickets to my show that night and gave them to that company well seven o\\u2019clock rolls around and everybody stumbles in takes their seats and then martin walks out and he asked the question \\u201cdo we have any americans\\u201d and instead of getting a \\u201cyay\\u201d \\u201cwhoo\\u201d \\u201cright here\\u201d he got\\u2026  they were so drunk they started chanting \\u201cusa usa usa usa\\u201d i\\u2019m in the dressing room hearing this i\\u2019m like \\u201cwhy are we here\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cwe could have done this in detroit\\u201d you know i had to fill out paperwork i\\u2019m like \\u201cthis is not cool\\u201d so during intermission martin comes backstage and he tells me \\u201cbro i don\\u2019t know if you heard\\u2026\\u201d  \\u201coh i heard\\u201d  \\u201cmight wanna mention it\\u201d i go \\u201coh i will\\u201d so at some point during my performance i told the audience \\u201cso a little bird told me there might be a couple of americans here tonight\\u201d \\u201cis that true\\u201d sure enough\\u2026  and they started doing it again  \\u201cusa usa usa\\u201d then it got quiet and you could hear \\u201c\\u2018murica\\u201d  i said \\u201cladies and gentlemen do you understand what just happened\\u201d \\u201cwe just made history\\u201d and people in the front row they\\u2019re like \\u201cwhat are you talking about history\\u201d i said \\u201cwe just made history\\u201d

i don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you but i appreciate very much well this is a nice place this is easily the nicest place for many miles in every direction that\\u2019s how you compliment a building and shit on a town with one sentence it is odd around here as i was driving here there doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here people just kind of walk in the middle of the road i love traveling and seeing all the different parts of the country i live in new york i live in a\\u2013 there\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all\\n\\u201cthe old lady and the dog\\u201d\\ni live\\u2013 i live in new york i always\\u2013 like there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood and she\\u2019s always walking her dog she\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old she just stands there just being old and the dog just fights gravity every day just\\u2013 the two of them it\\u2019s really\\u2013 the dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together and\\u2013 and she\\u2019s always wearing like this old sweater dress i guess it was a sweater when she was like \\u2019\\u201d but now it\\u2019s just like this sweater and her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare they\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out her legs are awful i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by and he was like \\u201cyecch no thank you \\u201ci do not want those \\u201ci\\u2019d rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit\\u201d i see these two all the time and i always look at them and i always think \\u201cgod i hope she dies first\\u201d i do i hope she dies first for her sake because i don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog i don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it if she dies\\u2013 if the old lady dies first i\\u2019m not worried about the dog because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady this dog is aware of three inches around his head he\\u2019s living in twosecond increments the second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left is all he knows about but if he dies this lady she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has and i know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him there\\u2019s no\\u2013 if she had one person in her life she would not keep this piece of shit little dog even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say \\u201cgood morning gladys\\u201d she\\u2019d be like \\u201cgood\\u201d and just flush him down the toilet just\\u2013 poom poom the dog just keeps bumping on the drain poom \\u201c\\u201d she gives up ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life ppp poom\\n\\u201cmy daughter likes fish\\u201d\\nyou ever flush a pet down the toilet i had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet i came home the fish was dead she wasn\\u2019t home from school yet so i just flushed the fish and that\\u2019s a weird moment too \\u2019cause fish live in water so you put it in the toilet floats to the bottom like \\u201cyeah he\\u2019s dead\\u201d and then you flush and it looks like he goes \\u201cwait a second aw shit \\u201ci was taking a nap jesus \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house\\u201d and then my daughter comes home \\u201cwhy did he die da\\u2013\\u201d come on what am i gonna say why did he die because who gives a shit that\\u2019s the reason that\\u2019s the actual reason is because didn\\u2019t matter that he was alive that\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead he didn\\u2019t know his name and he didn\\u2019t love you back these are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life my daughter likes fish we took her to the aquarium i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston and we were looking at this seal or sea lion i don\\u2019t know which one i don\\u2019t care i don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things i really don\\u2019t they don\\u2019t care and we don\\u2019t care there\\u2019s like three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say \\u201cok everybody \\u201cfrom now on seals and sea lions and walruses and\\u2013you know what\\u2013penguins are all seals now\\u201d and we would all be like \\u201cyeah all right fine yes whatever man\\u201d anyway so we\\u2019re looking at this sealsea lion thing and he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas and he\\u2019s going\\u2013 they\\u2019re really disgusting in person most animals are when you really see them you ever go to a farm you think you\\u2019re gonna see little white sheep going \\u201cbaa\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shitcolored and they\\u2019re like\\u2013 jesus that thing is awful anyway seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 they go\\u2013 my daughter\\u2019s like \\u201cwhat is he saying\\u201d i don\\u2019t know \\u201ci\\u2019m a slave kill me\\u201d\\n\\u201cthe food chain\\u201d\\nmust be awful to be other kinds of stuff you know i\\u2019m glad i\\u2019m this this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives anything else any other kind of thing you\\u2019re in the food chain you\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain i don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing life ends by being eaten that\\u2019s how all life ends is\\u2013 every single life except human life every life ends like this aah aah aah we\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed just \\u201ci love you bye\\u201d i mean imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else imagine if we were in the

\\u201cjust piss on me forever\\u201d anyway there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building and my first week in the building about a year ago i went down to the courtyard for the first time and i didn\\u2019t look too good you know it was a sunday morning that\\u2019s my least presentable hour there\\u2019s a lot of you know just stains just like you know food and me and whatever\\u2026 and so i\\u2019m sitting there so shut up ha ha ha anyway but so there i was i\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard and feeling a little out of place you know there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff and then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me i notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard and he\\u2019s all spiffylooking he\\u2019s got brown shoes and he\\u2019s looking at me like \\u201c\\u201d i can tell he was thinking i don\\u2019t live in the building he thinks i just wandered in off the streets and sat in the courtyard i can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over and dealing with me on his own and i\\u2019m sitting there thinking like \\u201cplease do that yes please come on come on come on come on come on\\u201d and i\\u2019m trying to look even more gross and i\\u2019m like pulling up my shirt \\u201c\\u201d and then i see him go \\u201cno that\\u2019s not gonna do at all\\u201d and he comes over to me \\u201c\\u201d and i\\u2019m like \\u201cnum num num\\u201d i\\u2019m so excited to have this thing a confrontation where i\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks i am \\u201crrgh\\u201d so he comes over says \\u201cexcuse me \\u201cdo you live in this building\\u201d and i said \\u201cno\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there i said \\u201cno\\u201d he goes \\u201cwell then what are you doing here\\u201d and i said \\u201ci just need to rest i\\u2019m having a hard time\\u201d he says \\u201cthis is private property\\u201d and i said \\u201cwell i don\\u2019t really believe in that\\u201d you know just the worst things i could say from his point of view is basically all the things i was saying and he goes \\u201cwell if you don\\u2019t leave i\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman\\u201d i was like \\u201ccan i just stay like five more hours\\u201d so he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and i see him talking about me to the doorman like this and then i see the doorman going \\u201cno that guy lives here it\\u2019s ok\\u201d and the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah num num\\u2013 it was just so\\u2013 it was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion it\\u2019s like i had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings that\\u2019s how excited i was\\n\\u201cgetting what \\u2018old\\u2019 is\\u201d\\ni\\u2019m  now so i\\u2019m

\\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad\\u201d if i die five years from now they\\u2019ll be like \\u201cwell all right\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 it\\u2019s\\u2013 like as soon as you\\u2019re  you\\u2019re a candidate you know there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for  guys that die and you start pushing\\u2013 you know some people get to be like   you know there are people that get to like  and then they\\u2019re in the news and it\\u2019s always some old guy \\u201ci met napoleon\\u201d no you didn\\u2019t you liar you oldest liar in the world but  you know you\\u2019re not old yet but you start having moments where you kind of start getting what old is especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself you know i have moments where i\\u2019m like \\u201cwow this seems early for this\\u201d like this is something that happens to me a lot i\\u2019ll be sitting watching tv or doing nothing and all of a sudden i\\u2019ll realize \\u201ci need to wipe my ass right now\\u201d \\u201ci mean nothing happened but i really gotta wipe my ass right now right now\\u201d gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass how does this happen already i\\u2019m  already my asshole\\u2019s just like \\u201cjust\\u2013 \\u201d my asshole\\u2013 my asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms just kinda\\u2026 loose and ineffectual my asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up it\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn full and open puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind some kid kicks it over on his way home from a tough day at middle school \\u201crats\\u201d that\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now if i\\u2019m\\u2013 ok say i\\u2019m sitting down if i\\u2019m sitting anywhere which\\u2013ha ha ha\\u2013 i love sitting so much\\u2013 i would take sitting and doing nothing to standing and fucking any day this is way better than coming this is way better this is what\\u2013 at my age if i\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me i need to get up and go to another room i need to be told all the information why first you gotta explain all that shit to me \\u201cwhat why do i\\u2013 no why though\\u201d \\u201cyour car is being towed right now\\u201d \\u201cwell that\\u2019s what happens to me then that\\u2019s\\u2013 i accept that\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing it means first i have to decide \\u201cdo i really want to be alive anymore\\u201d like let\\u2019s start with that and then i gotta \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum \\u201c\\u201d like i\\u2019m trying to get an old honda out of a snow bank \\u201cshit\\u201d\\n\\u201cputting on socks\\u201d\\nthe worst part of my day worst part of every day of my life is when i have to put on my socks putting on my socks is the worst part of every day and it always will be even if i have a terrible day in the future where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother if that ever happened to me the worst part of that day will be when i put on my socks because\\u2013 putting on my socks that means i have to\\u2013 here\\u2019s what i have to do i have to get my hands past my pointed toe i don\\u2019t even know how i do it i\\u2019m sitting here i don\\u2019t know how i do that it\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 it\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half soon as i start i can feel\\u2013 i\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs and i just feel all the systems failing \\u201cbeep beep beep\\u201d and i have to like lay on my back like an eightyearold and go like this and i start passing out and i know other people\\u2019s lives are hard ha ha ha i know i saw an interview on tv with michael j fox and he has parkinson\\u2019s and he was describing brushing his teeth and he said it takes him two hours a day and he said it\\u2019s agony and i saw this and i thought \\u201cok that\\u2019s hard\\u201d that is hard and so is putting on my socks sorry michael doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing tell you what i\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth you help me with the socks\\n\\u201cif

in an argument with somebody and they\\u2019re older than you you should listen to them it doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right it means that even if they\\u2019re wrong their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have they\\u2019ve been there longer if you\\u2019re older you\\u2019re smarter how many people here by applause are  or older  or older applaud ok that\\u2019s about  people

there\\u2019s just nobody for them yep people like to say things like \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone\\u201d nope not at all true and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody there are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips even nobody touches their genitals their entire life they just wash it and then they die that\\u2019s all that happens \\u201caww\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart \\u201caww\\u201d well go fuck one \\u201cnah\\u201d i didn\\u2019t think so that\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean nobody does that nobody fucks down nobody people fuck up or across some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up some guy \\u201cyeah no you should i\\u2019m totally up yeah\\u201d\\n\\u201cdating takes courage\\u201d\\nit\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have dating really is\\u2013 it\\u2019s how we evolve is dating it\\u2019s how we choose each other and dating is a real drag for a lot of people but i always think it\\u2019s a nice thing you know when i see a date i\\u2019m always happy when i see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying you know you see a couple on a date it means there\\u2019s still courage out there that takes courage to go on a date for both sides two very different kinds of courage the male courage traditionally speaking is that he decided to ask he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified everything in your body is telling you \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off don\\u2019t do this\\u201d but he walked up and said \\u201chi yes\\u201d and she\\u2019s like \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno no no a second give me a second\\u201d and you try to get through this membrane of you know\\u2013 and then if it works and you say \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime\\u201d sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes and if she says yes that\\u2019s her courage and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and illadvised and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it and i don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men we\\u2019re the numberone threat to women globally and historically we\\u2019re the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to women we\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them that\\u2019s true you know what our numberone threat is heart disease that\\u2019s the whole thing that\\u2019s it just our own heart going \\u201cdude i can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart\\u201d but women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah i\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night\\u201d what are you nuts \\u201ci\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders hi where are we going\\u201d \\u201cto your death statistically\\u201d how do they still do it if you\\u2019re a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and you\\u2019re like \\u201ci hope this one\\u2019s nice i hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do\\u201d\\n\\u201cfirst date\\u201d\\ni always\\u2013 i love when i see a date you know when you see a date you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together and she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out and he\\u2019s just a mess a guy on a first date just has no actual personality he\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each just anything no cohesive\\u2013 just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines just you know \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha \\u201cwell yes i think so too ha ha rrgh\\u2026\\u201d whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened there\\u2019s something that happens in a date that i never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly \\u201ci\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me\\u201d they just get to decide something he says and she\\u2019s like \\u201cthat was good he\\u2019s gonna fuck me later\\u201d and he has no idea he\\u2019s still like trying all this shit he still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there\\n\\u201ctits\\u201d\\nguys are\\u2013 we love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 and we just look at you that\\u2019s what i do i just look at women i just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d like they\\u2019re you know cakes in windows i just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d i was walking in new york once and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me and i was trying to walk slowly so i could hear what they were saying to each other you know \\u2019cause they were cute so i wanted to hear them like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for like one second\\u201d ok here here i go thank you it\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that if you\\u2019re a woman you could ask any guy on planet earth \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second\\u201d and  of us will go \\u201cyes of course\\u201d that doesn\\u2019t matter i could be doing open heart surgery \\u201cyeah ok\\u201d beep \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry he\\u2019s not your tits don\\u2019t worry about it\\u201d i don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed but so do women or you know baby women not grownup women don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 you don\\u2019t see like a  woman like a stately look\\u2013 you know like sigourney weaver like sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit \\u201cthank you deborah i\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at \\u201d it\\u2019s not usually the thing is the elderly breastfeeding from the young except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath\\u201d which i don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you but you should have read it by now i don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath\\u201d but that\\u2019s how it ends with an old dying man sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits and then the book is over and you\\u2019re like \\u201cjesus what happened at the end there that\\u2019s crazy\\u201d there\\u2019s no other book in that genre there\\u2019s no dense historic classic that ends with a weird porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then anna karenina shat on his chest\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that\\u201d \\u201cthe end\\u201d \\u201cmy god \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book i\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months\\u201d but we do we love tits and you always know a tit you always know a tit you know like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 like a subway or like you know a sports stadium\\u2013 and you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people and your elbow touches a tit behind you you\\u2019re like \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit i just touched it i know that was a tit i know it\\u201d because the sensitivity of the male elbow to tit flesh specifically is unbelievable just to tits \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there i\\u2019m not gonna feel it but a tit\\u2013 through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket and her jacket sweater shirt and bra somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit i touched a tit \\u201ci touched a tit i touched one tit one tit\\u201d that\\u2019s rare to touch one tit it\\u2019s like a fourleaf clover usually you touch two the only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident or you didn\\u2019t have permission but otherwise\\u2026 when tit access is granted it\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time it\\u2019s once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 you really have to screw up really badly and quickly to lose tit access between tits one and two you must have said something really dumb on the first tit that you didn\\u2019t get the second one \\u201cyeah it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit\\u201d \\u201cwhy what i said i liked it

single person was blocking their vision of their actual child with their phone and the kids\\u2013 i went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 there\\u2019s people holding ipads in front of their faces it looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program like the kids can\\u2019t see their parents and everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 like look at your fucking kid the resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look it\\u2019s totally hd why are you taping this you\\u2019re never gonna watch it in a million years

being short i got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift when you think about what you get with a basic life not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life if you have a life that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life this is basic cable what you get when you get life you get to be on earth first of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location this is earth and for trillions of miles in every direction it fucking sucks so bad it\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad you get to be on earth and look at shit as long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is you get to be here you get to eat food you get to put bacon in your mouth i mean when you have bacon in your mouth it doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything you just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d every time i\\u2019m eating bacon i think \\u201ci could die right now\\u201d and i mean it that\\u2019s how good life is you get to\\u2013 you get to fuck that\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart that comes with that\\u2019s part of the deal where else are you gonna get that deal you get to put your dick in there and go in and out pretty good and if you\\u2019re a woman you get to just lay back and just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly anytime you want anytime you want if you\\u2019re a gay man you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick just fill it all the way to the balls and it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there and he\\u2019s your buddy if you\\u2019re a lesbian you get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing and\\u2026 it\\u2019s a great deal you get to eat you get to fuck you get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird\\u201d it\\u2019s a great life so you know i\\u2019m not worried about it ending\\n\\u201cbehind the wheel\\u201d\\nit\\u2019s pretty good and i\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i don\\u2019t know you know it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people depending on the situation like most people are ok as long as they\\u2019re ok but if you put people in certain contexts they just change like when i\\u2019m in my car i have a different set of values i am the worst person i can be when i\\u2019m behind the wheel which is when i\\u2019m at my most dangerous when you\\u2019re driving that\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get and i am the worst one time i was driving and there was a guy ahead of me and he kind of\\u2013i don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second and this came out of my mouth i said \\u201cworthless piece of shit\\u201d i mean what an indictment what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being \\u201cworthless piece of shit\\u201d that\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son and things i\\u2019ve said to other people i was once driving and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 i don\\u2019t remember even\\u2013 and i yelled out my window i said \\u201chey fuck you\\u201d where outside of a car is that even nearly ok if you were in an elevator and you were like right next to a person\\u2019s body and whatever like he leaned into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go \\u201chey fuck you\\u201d \\u201cworthless piece of shit\\u201d no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them \\u201ci hope you die\\u201d i said that to a person \\u201ci hope you die\\u201d why \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life you tested my reflexes and it worked out fine so now i hope your kids grow up motherless\\u201d i mean what am i capable of i\\u2019d like to think that i\\u2019m a nice person but i don\\u2019t know man\\n\\u201cif murder was legal\\u201d\\na lot of it is context there\\u2019s a lot of things i wonder if the world was different like if murder was legal i might have killed a few people i don\\u2019t know i\\u2019d love to think \\u201ci would never do that\\u201d but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder is the numberone thing preventing murder we\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause like \\u201ci would never do that\\u201d no it\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering a lot if murder was legal or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit they had a camera there well\\u201d if murder was legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderers would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder if murder was legal you wouldn\\u2019t like them \\u201ci never killed anybody\\u201d \\u201cok nice meeting you yecch what a creep \\u201ci mean not even a hooker live a life \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy he\\u2019s like a mormon or some shit i hate those guys\\u201d \\u201ci think he\\u2019s nice\\u201d \\u201cshut up janet\\u201d they would just\\u2013 if murder was legal there would be a lot of murder children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids that\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal you know you\\u2019d go to a mall there\\u2019d be like eight different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201ci told you to stop it you didn\\u2019t listen to me\\u201d just\\u2013pbbt there\\u2019d be just\\u2013 you\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids there\\u2019d be like a new problem \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of america \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate in which case you could just leave them in the bag\\u201d that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row right in a row that is a compressed area of bad thought\\n\\u201cof course but maybe\\u201d\\nyou know you have your bad thoughts hopefully you do good things everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts hopefully the good thoughts win for me i always have both i have like the thing i believe the good thing\\u2013 that\\u2019s the thing i believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing and i don\\u2019t believe it but it is there it\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing it\\u2019s become a category in my brain that i call \\u201cof course\\u2026 but maybe\\u2026\\u201d i\\u2019ll give you an example ok like of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected of course we have to segregate their food from nuts have their medication available at all times and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies of course but maybe\\u2026 maybe if touching a nut kills you you\\u2019re supposed to die of course not of course not of course not jesus i have a nephew who has that i\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever no of course not of course if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy of course of course\\u2026 but maybe\\u2026 maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot it\\u2019s not that weird maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at it\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened listen listen you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts for kids dying from nuts you applauded so you\\u2019re in this with me now do you understand you don\\u2019t get to cherrypick those kids did nothing to you of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened of course it is every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 black people in america jews in egypt every time a whole race of people has been enslaved it\\u2019s a terrible horrible thing of course\\u2026 but maybe\\u2026 maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves every single thing where you go \\u201chow did they build those pyramids\\u201d they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just threw chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them there\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people you can do anything that\\u2019s where human greatness comes from is that we\\u2019re shitty people that we fuck others over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where they\\u2019re making these they jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean

welcome to the stage ali wonghi hello welcome thank you thank you for coming hello hello we are gonna have to get this shit over with cause i have to pee in like ten minutes but thank you everybody so much for comingum its a very exciting day for me its been a very exciting year for me i turned  this year yes thank you five people i appreciate that uh i can tell that im getting older because now when i see an  girl my automatic thought is fuck you fuck you i dont even know you but fuck you cause im straight up jealous im jealous first and foremost of their metabolism because  girls they could just eat like shit and then they take a shit and have a sixpack right they got thatthat beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and theres that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating throughand then when they go to sleep they just go to sleep right they dont have insomnia yet they dont know what its like to have to take a ambien or download a meditation oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind they have their whole lives ahead of them they dont have hpv yet they just go to sleep in peace at night everybody has hpv ok everybody has it its ok come out already everybody has it if you dont have it yet you go and get it you go and get it its coming you dont have hpv yet youre a fucking loser all right thats what that says about you a lot of men dont know that they have hpv because its undetectable in men its really fucked up hpv is a ghost that lives inside mens bodies and says boo in womens bodies my doctor told me that i have one of two strains of hpv either i have the kind thats gonna turn into cervical cancer or i have the kind where my body will heal itself very helpful this doctor right so basically either im gonna die or youre in the presence of wolverine bitches well find outum i can also tell that im getting older because my kindle is turning into a selfhelp library im not interested in books like fifty shades of grey ok im interested in the lifechanging magic of tidying up yes yes thats right how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success thats what your  is all about how can i turn this shit around im a horrible person im not happy with where i am how can i turn this shit around help me tony robbins help mei have a hoarding problem which im hoping is the center of all of my other problems im hoping that if the hoarding goes away the hpv will also disappear i have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything because you never know when a dictators gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth so you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade cause it might come in handy as a shovel when youre busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the communiststhe last time i was at home in san francisco i was trying to help her get rid of shit dont ever do that with your mom it was like the worst experience of my life it was so emotional we were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a texas instruments  manual the manual she dont even know where the calculator is those of you under  probably dont know what that calculator is it was this calculator that bamboozled my generation we were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade it cost like  and everybody thought it was like this judy jetsons laptop from the future all because what it could graph it was like the tesla of my time and my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like you never know when you might need this and i was like but i do know that im gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die and im not trying to be a procrastinator anymore because according to deepakoprah thats not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of successi grew up a lot this past year uh this past year i also got married yeah to a man who now has hpv very lucky guy he gave me something i gave him something that will also last forever no really im the lucky girl because before him i dated a lot of losers lots of losers a lot of skaters you wanna be a grownass woman stop dating skaters stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen theyre sexy on the outside malt liquor on the inside horrible but my husband i first met him at this wedding and uh hes\\u2013 hes much better looking than me hes way out of my league and i saw him and i was like oh my god who is that and the first thing i learned about him was that at the time he was attending harvard business school and i was like oh my god im gonna trap his ass going to trap his ass and i trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date which is a very unusual move on my part but i did it on purpose because i knew that he was a catch so i was like all right ali you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden when really its a public park that has hosted many reggae fests and has even accidentally let two homeless people inside i thought they were hipsters ok that store urban outfitters has made things very confusing for my generation you homeless or you a hipster is that beard for fashion or for warmth it happened to it happened in san francisco when i was living there and i saw this guy in broad daylight and we had like we had we had so much chemistry he was like hey wassup i was like wassup and we\\u2013 the next thing i knew we were getting busy in the back of my volvo and then after we were done he was like hey can you drop me off i was like where he was like at the park and i dropped him off at golden gate park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends and i was like oh no i just fucked a homeless dude againmy husband is asian which a lot of people are shocked by because usually asianamerican women who like you know wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions they like to date white dudes you go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in america and that shit is turning into a yoko ono factory its too much i dont know whats wrong with these bitches i get it you know because being with a white dude you feel very you feel very picturesque when youre with a white dude you know you feel like youre in a wes anderson movie or something and you know white dudes they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling and disturbing documentaries they introduce you to cool stuff like that and its very you know its hot hookin up with a white dude i mean nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy oh my god i just feel like im absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement you know just right there through the money hole and just and then also hes so vulnerable down there im like i could just crush your head at any moment white man i could just kill you right now crush those brains colonize the colonizer you knowbut i think that for marriage it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race the advantage is that you get to go home and be racist together you get to say whatever you like you dont gotta explain shit my husband halffilipino halfjapanese im halfchinese and halfvietnamese and we spend  percent of our time shitting on korean people its amazing its what love is built on you knowmy last boyfriend was cuban and his family would shit on mexican people all the time and i was like hold it you guys arent mexican asianamerican men are very underrated i dont know why people dont go for them theyre the sexiest asian men are the sexiest they got no body hair from the neck down its like making love to a dolphin oh my god its so smooth just like a slip and slide just black fish tilikum all up in my bed every night you know oohwee you mess with a jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards its all red and inflamed and youre like i did not ask to be exfoliated today this is the last time i go on jdate more like loofah date thanks for the rug burn avi and then asian men no body odor none they just smell like responsibility thats where the umami flavor comes fromi think my husband and i have a huge unspoken understanding uh between each other because hes halffilipino and halfjapanese and im halfchinese and halfvietnamese so were both halffancy asian and halfjungle asian yeah you guys know the difference the fancy asians are the chinese the japanese they get to do fancy things like host olympics jungle asians host diseases its its different but he grew up on the east coast going to private school playing lacrosse uh you know learning latin and playing chess and rugby he grew up like filipino carlton ok so he didnt know anything about vietnamese people until he met me and on one of our first dates he took me to this restaurant on the west side of los angeles called pho show he was like its authentic vietnamese i read about it on yelp i was like its not authentic ok you can tell first and foremost by the name cause it dont got a number in it second of all you can tell by the bathroom if it was legit the bathroom would double as a supply closet when i pee i need to see ten gallons of bleach an atm machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner and the wait staff here is too nice we need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abusedi grew up going to private school too him and i are both total like private school asians we both are big hippies too we like to backpack through southeast asia we like to do yoga we do ayahuasca ceremonies we do silent meditation retreats thats right we pay  to shut up for a weekend we do shit like that uh we eat glutenfree which means we eat all that bread that tastes like freerange chewbacca we eat that lesbian bread thats like a thousand percent of your daily fiber and  percent spoken word poetry when you eat it you queef a shitty poem about supporting caitlyn jenner or whatever and so its funny right because hes asian too but sometimes all of this hippydippy shit we do makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of asian people like we have these chinese scrolls up on the wall and neither of us know what the fuck they mean were like oh that seems to go very well with our buddha piggy bank from pier  imports that seems to be providing some good feng shui for the househim and i had been dating for four years and i\\u2013 i just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose because i had been pressuring him to do it so you know i just had this wacky womens intuition thats how proposals really work ok a woman has to incept the idea into the mans head first passively and then if he doesnt get the message extremely aggressively you gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving because you know that youre too old and its too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again so youre like im just gonna stick with this dude focus on trapping this dude and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like shut the fuck up fine will you marry me and then afterwards the woman is always like oh my god he proposed it came outta nowhere and look he got me the exact ring i wanted how did he know maybe he saw it on my pinterest page or something that i sent to my best friend that i told her to send to him every day let me tell you something if a man has a pinterest page hes probably pinterested in men we got engaged on a saturday i bought my wedding dress the following tuesday because i had tried it on in  i was ready i was ripe i was rotten i need to be made into banana bread thats how rotten i waspeople are always very surprised at how offstage with my husband im a completely different person you\\u2013 like you would not recognize my personality at all with him with him im very soft and like very nurturing and very domestic weve been together now for five years and for five years ive packed his lunch every single day yeah yes yes yes i did that so that hed become dependent on me cause he graduated from harvard business school and i dont wanna work anymore i dont i straight up dont wanna work anymore i dont feed him out of the goodness of my heart i do it as an investment in my financial future cause i dont wanna work anymore ive been reading that book by sheryl sandberg shes the coo of facebook and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top and her book is called lean in well i dont wanna lean in ok i wanna lie down i want to lie the fuck down i think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women our job used to be no job we had it so good we could have done the smart thing which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like were dumb women we dont know how to do anything so i guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch ellen cause were too stupid to have any real responsibility and then all these women had to show off and be like we could do it we could do anything bitch shut up dont tell them the secret they ruined it for us and now were expected to work when i hear the phrase doubleincome household i wanna throw up a lot of women get very upset with me about those comments and theyre like but ali we have so many more options now oh you dont think we had a lot of options when our day was free unscheduled unsupervised and most importantly sponsored do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn ita lot of my friends when we walk around together theyll get very judgmental about housewives that well see on the street and theyll be like look at that fucking housewife not doing anything look at that housewife just walking around all day getting massages in her lululemon pants im like that bitch is a genius shes not a housewife shes retiredi do write for fresh off the boat on abc yeah which is its a great show i love it a lot i love my coworkers its a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs its probably one of the best you could ask for but i still gotta work at a office every day which means i gotta shit in a office every day housewives they dont gotta shit in a office housewives get to shit in their house skin to seat they dont gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover they dont gotta ten times a day every day like youre about to eat a sadass meal they dont gotta do that they dont gotta use that oneply toilet paper that office toilet paper that they purposely make difficult to pull out they try to ration me with their communist toilet paper thats not even effective it basically just dehydrates your butt hole its basically like wiping your butt with the desert i literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago to try to make a macgyver baby wipe to moisten it and then it backfired cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out and then i had to start all over again and you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed cause youre paranoid that your coworkers gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall and youre like oh no courtneys listening shes waiting shes timing me and then you hurry hurry hurry and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long and then if you dare scratch yourself your underwear at the end of the day looks like its been run over by the goonies housewives they dont gotta muffle their shit too they dont gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out they dont gotta try to you know squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep deep shame housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much netflix on their ipad as they want they dont gotta take these boring repressed shits they can listen to podcasts planet money they can do whatever they wantyou know its\\u2013 its very distracting for me when i hear my coworkers blow ass into the toilet i lose respect for them nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence i heard one of my coworkers blow ass into the toilet the other day this bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say you need to get to work on time i was like you need to eat bananas i saw those green ballet flats i know that shit was you dont try to tell me to get my shit together when i heard you not have your shit togethermy fatherinlaw had this huge sitdown with me and my husband recently um and he was like hey i wanna talk to you guys about money you guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had i was like why you telling me this shit i should not be a part of this conversation you tell you son that dont your understand that i trapped your son for his earning potential why else would i choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life i chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement and when i said i do what i really meant was oh im done im done i dont wanna work anymore and im not dieting anymore since i got married last year ive been eating fried chicken skin every day since thats right and just fulfilling my destiny which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes like mrs pacman just lets redecoratei gave up a lot of myself when i got married im a\\u2013 im a disgusting pervert im a pervert im a gross filthy animal and i think its because i started watching porn at a very young age and what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that yyou get sicker and sicker and sicker the images you crave get sicker and sicker and sicker but its ok because the internet will always catch up to youi broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back i was like uh youre a idiot dude do you realize that if i went on craigslist and posted tiny asian female seeking anal the internet would crash and all the jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode they would explode a lot of women get really you know freaked out about anal and theyre like oh i dont wanna do that im scared of\\u2013 of the pain you aint scared of the pain women they wax their eyebrows they do all sorts of crazy shit youre not scared of the pain what youre really scared of is doo doo on the dick youre scared that hes gonna see that and thats gonna be all of your shame your inner evil all your secrets and lies sephora cant help you now but dont worry cause when he puts it in the butt all hes thinking about is i just put it in her butt i gotta go call my mom my dad dave my grandma youre\\u2013 if youre married youre gonna have to do anal eventually ok you have to because you gotta change it up you gotta change it up so that you dont cheat on each other you gotta keep it interesting if you put it in different holes maybe youll feel like youre fucking different people i was very sexually active in my  and as a result im a little bit stretched out down there ok so when i finally did anal i just felt like i got a second chance at life you know i was like oh my god its like im going back in time\\u266a a whole new world \\u266ait was magicala big fantasy of mine before i got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate yeah like a conqueror i just wanted to now if you havent done it before ladies go home and treat yourself do it tonight you only live once yolo just sneak your\\u2013 just give your man a little\\u2013 a little pushpush in the tushtush just give him a little atari you know and youll get a lot of resistance from the man at first youll get a lot of no no no no please no really i dont\\u2013 no i dont i dont no they get all squirmy wormy because theyre scared theyre scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed and they like it that then it might mean that theyre gay and i like that fear that shit turns me on you know especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure oh my god and you just see the look in the mans eye like hes discovered nirvana and its like youre the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole and then you as the woman in his eyes just become the lord of the rim you knowmy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me when\\u2013 when ive asked him to spank me this is what he does hey hey are you ok are you all right you know i respect you right im like yes i know you respect me and thats why you need to abuse me ok cause its the most strongheaded loudmouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed women who are ceos they just wanna be roughed around they just want their\\u2013 glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 its because were so in control all the time that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control you know like i dont wanna die dont kill me i dont wanna die but i also dont want to be sure that im gonna live you know i just wanna be out of control for once just\\u2013 just choke me enough so that i cant talk cause if i can talk im gonna tell you what to do and im tired of being the boss im the boss all the time so in the bedroom you be the boss yes because im the real boss and i told you so motherfucker so do itsheryl sandberg that woman who wrote lean in has had such a big impact that now because of her there is a ban on the word bossy in elementary schools because according to her its sexist to use the word bossy because boys are never called bossy so now instead of saying youre bossy youre supposed to say you have executive leadership skills which is a very roundabout way of saying youre a little cuntim just waiting for the right moment to like become a housewife financially you know i want my husband to get us to like a certain point financially i wanna get to the point as a couple where i can comfortably afford sliced mango know what im talking about im talking about that whole foods mango that  whole foods mango that was sliced by white people thats the kind of income bracket im striving for thats when you know youve made it when youre eating mango

like a princessi have some useful advice for all my asianamerican brothers and sisters yeah never go paintballing with a vietnam veteranso i dont know if you guys can tell but i am seven and a half months pregnant yeah its very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant because female comics dont get pregnant just try to think of one i dare you theres\\u2013 none of them once they do get pregnant they generally disappear thats not the case with male comics once they have a baby theyll get up on stage a week afterwards and theyll be like guys i just had this fucking baby that babys a little piece of shit its so annoying and boring and all these other shitty dads in the audience are like thats hilarious i identify and their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden meanwhile the mom is at home chapping her nipples feeding the fucking baby and wearing a frozen diaper cause her pussy needs to heal from the babys head shredding it up shes busy so i dont know whats gonna happen to me you know a lot of my female standup comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid and they were like ali why are you gonna have a kid you just gonna become\\u2013 youre gonna disappear and youre gonna become some lame stayathome mom i was like yeah thats the dream thats the point this is the ultimate trap i won you knowanother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid they were like why are you gonna have a kid why dont you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached i was like yeah thats cool until my husband dies which hes definitely gonna before me because im a asian woman and therefore guaranteed to live until im a billion im guaranteed like a turtle from the galapagos ok we all know the phrase black dont crack well asian dont die we dont die especially the women we live forever and you know why were such bad drivers because were trying to die were like yeah let me see how invincible i really am imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely im gonna make a right turn\\u2013 i changed my mind its a uturn i changed my mind again its a oturn every time i get into a car accident im like oh my god not again i need to hide my face so that everybody doesnt see that its what everybody thought it was gonna be so embarrassing my toyota corolla is a mess theres this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere and then on the hood theres multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence i dont know whats wrong with me but im still here you knowi need to have children to keep me company when i get older its lonely my mom is  going through a full blown midlife crisis cause she knows that shes got a century more to go and she is so lonely all of her white friends dead her mexican friends dead black friends dead im just kidding she doesnt have any black friends life is not rush hour the movie ok i need children to be there for me when im older when i get as old as her and when i say be there for me i mean pay for me when my husband isnt around to support me anymore im not trying to be one of those old chinese ladies who recycles for a living thats not my destiny ok old chinese ladies they dont give a fuck they got no shame theyre like im just gonna recycle go bald go to the park do this shit they do that cause its a free activity for them they do it in their\\u2013 their bigass v stiviano visor their darth vadertomb raider boba fett helmet they wear that to protect themselves from their archnemesis the sun their in a contest to see whos gonna burn out first old asian ladies and the sun are like the tupac and biggie of longevityi also decided to have a kid because uh im only  which i know is not technically highrisk but my body was starting to show signs of change and it\\u2013 and it scared me like im only  and my pussy is not as wet as it used to be its very demoralizing ok do you remember when you were  years old and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time all the time you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment you throw up the peace sign afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your fingers oh my god it was so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just i slime you i slime you ghostbustersi dont know what kind of mother im gonna be im\\u2013 im  and i did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant and a lot of that is most likely my fault because when i was in my  i ate plan b like skittles so my uterus probably looked like a smokers lung and i found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low so then i had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat i would be storyboarding in front of my coworkers and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and i had to act like everything was ok when everything was clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy so then i had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards i want to be able to smell my fingers when i wanna smell my own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about is when can i smell my fingers when can i smell my fingers when can i discretely find a way to smell my fingers nature made you urgently curious to protect you cause you gotta check that its all good in the hood if its too funky you need to see a doctor your fingers are your first webmdwhen my husband and i were trying to have a kid a lot of people were like oh my god thats so hot you guys doin a lot of fuckin no dude thats\\u2013 thats shit you do in your  ok when in\\u2013 when youre in your  and youve been trying to get pregnant for a while it gets very clinical you pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin it tells you when its easter time and i would only fuck him when it was easter time it was like only four days out of the month and outside of that i would be like were not fuckin i need you to save it i want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out its like release the kraken and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship you know and um yeah and most of the time like we wouldnt even have sex cause i was so tired when i would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and id be like ok its go time and i would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eyes immediately i know what that means ok when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelids which is fine by me because then he doesnt have to see the expression on my face that says please hurry the fuck up and then when he was about to finish i could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish its when they get that that stupidass look on their face where they look like they just got bit by a zombie just and then because were hippies id be like hey hey please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then i would jump on him and hold onto his neck and i would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of him and do some of this shit that i learned in atlanta and then i would turn upside down immediately afterwards to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of me thats right cause i dont wanna work anymoreim very grateful to be pregnant and to be this far along to be seven and a half months pregnant because last year i had a miscarriage which is very common and a lot of women who are in their  flip out when they hear that theyre like oh my god thats so dark and terrible i cant believe that im  girl when youre  youll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage its super common and i wish more women would talk about it so they wouldnt feel so bad when they go through it when i told my mom\\u2013 shes from a third world country and when i told her i had one she was like uh yeah where im from thats like losing a pair of shoes its whatevs ok and everything happens for a reason i found out at my sixweek sonogram which is very early and the doctor says to me oh my god i see two sacks which means youre having twins and i was like no and then she said but what i dont see is a heartbeat and i was like yes the lord is mysterious dont feel bad ok they were the size of poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that i lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through a miscarriage i sat my husband down in front of me while i sat on the toilet and i was like you look you watch the whole thing and he felt so bad for me and i used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck i wanted him to do for  days he took me to see beyonc\\u00e9 he bought me a bike off of craigslist thats my miscarriage bike and i love it very much for  days i finally had the marriage i always wantedim scared about giving childbirth though im\\u2013 im very very scared of childbirth thats why im going to hire a doula you know what that is you know what a doula is thats a white hippie witch that blows quinoa into your pussy to keyser s\\u00f6ze all the pain away a lot of women tried to freak me out they tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying ali did you know that youre gonna poop on the table i was like yeah i look forward to it im all backed up from holding in my shit at work i cant wait to cleanse it makes sense like that you\\u2013 that that happens because when youre in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think thats enough to make him finally leave you boom a baby comes out and he gotta stay thats the real miracle of life right there i can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby hasnt even come out yet and i am already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he asks me to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dishes no can you water the plants i am not doing jack shit anymore im busy makin a eyeball ok are you makin a foot i didnt think so you change the channeli can already see how theres like this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad and it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom people praise my husband for coming to all of my doctors appointments with me oh my god i cant believe he comes to all your doctors appointments he is so supportive guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments me im the star of the show theres nothing for the camera to see if im not there but hes the hero for playing candy crush while i get my blood drawn meanwhile if i do mushrooms seven months pregnant im a bad mommyyou know i\\u2013 i\\u2013 i like i berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because i really am mad at him but mostly out of survival because if he leaves me im fucked so i have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis to keep him down so that he doesnt believe that hes worthy of another womans affection and leaves me i gotta keep him around by keeping him down people dont tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipples get huge and dark i didnt know that i didnt know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easier and then you know they get big\\u2013 they get big like fingers like you you you owe me money you my nipples look like whoppers now and naked i look like a minion but im not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see me in a year i will have the kind of body where if i do a nude scene on television people will commend me for being courageous for doing itnow that im seven and a half months pregnant my pussys all wet again but its different its not like when i was  years old when it was like really hot you know and i was like why is it different and i looked it up and my pussys all wet again because my\\u2013 my bodys secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it thats not the same when its straight up soldier glue when its neosporinso you know i\\u2013 i in\\u2013 previously before i met my husband i had dated a bunch of losers and then i meet this dream guy whos like way more handsome than me out of my league graduated from harvard business school worked hard to trap his ass got him to propose to me oh my god then we got married all my dreams coming true and then we got pregnant and recently we bought our first home together and uh two weeks into the escrow process i discovered that my beautiful harvardeducated husband was  in debt and me with my hardearned tv money paid it all off so as it turns out hes the one who trapped me how did he do it how did he bamboozle me oh maybe because he went to harvard business school the epicenter of whitecollar crime he enrond my ass and now if i dont work we die why else do you think im performing seven and a half months pregnantall right ive been ali wong have a

since were here only in dade thank you so much if you know you know  and i think you know  and also to my friends over at la carreta for all the food soyes  yeah man before we get started you guys uh i would like to thank the hard rock hotel and casino for the opportunity to record a special no other entertainer has done a special here yet tonight is the first oneit wasnt the rolling stones it wasnt the eagles they trusted a comedian  to make this happen so i wanna say thank you is anybody else staying here at the uh at the hard rock  hey me toothis is a beautiful hotel and im not just saying that cause my room is free  you know youre in a nice hotel and casino when you turn on your tv in your room and they have their own video like if youre staying here you turn on the tv you get this   welcome to the hard rock hotel and casino   twentyfourhour gambling seven days a week  days a year  im sitting there like why cant i stop watching this and i started thinking at this point why dont they just do that to the slot machines you know gamblings already shameless might as well go all the way you walk up to one of the little machines pop in a      dont stop  im not gonna  people are walking by what are you doing trying to get the jackpot yeah man im gonna start the show off tonight with a question thats not how comedy shows happen but im gonna start it with a question the question is who here tonight has never heard of me up until tonight  five two five okay to those of you the five of you i say sorry i know you got excited you saw the ticket you saw the last name and then i walked out and youre like enrique got bigger  the only reason why i ask who has never seen or heard of me before is because if you have then you know the type of show that i do and you know the type of show that i dont do like im not here to tell you who to vote for who not to vote for what shot to take or what baby to get rid of thats not for me to say if youre already offended you missed the point im telling you what im not gonna do i promise you i am here to entertain not offend okay  were gonna have fun with everybody starting with me but im gonna let you know were living in a different time ive been doing this so long i always figured as long as im being nice i shouldnt have any issues but its a very different time this is year  for meyeah twentyseven years of being a comedian and in those  years i never had to worry you know when i first got started shoot  i was cleanshaven i had hair i know look at some of you what happened huh vaccine i know im kidding im kid im kidding sorry florida im kidding im kidding i said vaccine some of you were like i told you yeah   i told you he said so   some friends tell me dude man youre making money now why dont you get the hair thingy i said for what well you know some women they want a guy with hair well good for themand theyre not lying i have gone out with some women that made it a point to tell me that hair was important one told me flat out i need to be able to run my fingers through your hair yeah and i told her hey look if you go deep enough  youre gonna get your wish you were not specific on location hey you want hair you want pelos i got you but yeah  years of being a comedian and in those  years i have seen a lot of comedians come and go and i feel very grateful that in all that time weve still managed to maintain a certain levelso i feel like were doing something right which feels weird to me because now i feel like you gotta be very mindful okay you gotta be extra mindful like uh  years of being a comedian i finally started hearing people tell me things that ive never heard before i started hearing people tell me things like hey fluffy i grew up watching you  which is an incredible compliment because that doesnt just say that youre a fan that says that youre invested that says that youve been following this career for a very long time some of you the first time you saw me perform you were kids  and now some of you are here tonight with your kids  and so i just want to say thank you for all those years of trust and continuing to come back to see the show it means a lot  hearing someone say they grew up watching me that is one of the most beautiful compliments any entertainer can receive and i understand that now with therapy that thats what that meanslook im not gonna lie the first time i heard someone tell me that they grew up watching me i didnt know how to handle it i didnt know how to process because nobody wants to feel like theyre getting old the first time i heard it i was like  second time i heard it i was like buy a hat the third time i accepted it i was like  many years ago when i first got started all of this was land as far as the eye could see it was a very different time and by the way i dont know why my old voice is white  he just is i tried doing the mexican voice but you dont take him as serious  well screw you we were at the ranch and were told to fuck off dude its very tough out there  but times are changing the rules are changing so i dont know how much longer this is gonna be okay ill tell you what happened to me and why i brought that up i did a podcast and before i went into the studio im talking to the producer outside and the producers excited and happy and shes like gabriel iglesias were so excited to have you this is really cool before you go in the host wanted me to ask you something before you go in for your interview i go sure go for it okay what do you identify as  i wasnt sure how to answer that im  years old i didnt know what to say i was like shit hungry i guessi mean im tired sleepy depressed on tuesdays i dont know what you want me to say see heres the thing i knew what she was trying to ask me i just wasnt trying to get involved in a conversation about something that has absolutely nothing to do with me this was yeah  i felt like i was being baited because no matter how i answered that question i was gonna find myself in an awkward situation so you know because for me i was just like let me just be funny but nowadays you cant just not answer the question because silence is seen as a problem and im sorry if me not answering a certain question is considered a problem i was brought up during a time where you were constantly told to mind your businessthats all im trying to do is stay in my lane another thing we were constantly told was always respect your elders  and no matter what generation you were from that was at least the one thing we could always agree on until now now older people are seen as a problem they are you know and i understand the youth of today has the technology in the palm of their hands and you can google just about anything but you cannot google life experience okay you cant you cant download struggling you cant download failure you cant download these moments that help build you up to make you a better person and so again for me i chose to stay in my lane and just crack jokes when the girl asked me the question she got very upset she got very offended as soon as i cracked the joke she was like no thats not what i mean i mean what are your pronouns what what are your pronouns for example are you a they or them a they  or a them  how fat am i  when did i stop being an it apparently i ate myself into a plural thats what happenedwhat im finding is even if you have good intentions and youre trying to be cool you can still find yourself in a situation so ill tell you what else happened to me mkay i was at a mcdonalds  thats not even the joke but okay  all righty theyre like here this is gonna be good no no i was at a mcdonalds by my house the mcdonalds by my house is actually a twofer its a mcdonalds on the corner and its also a gas station i got a big suv i knew it was gonna be a minute so i said let me go get some nuggets while im here i walk into the mcdonalds and as im walking in i couldnt help but notice this homeless family sitting right outside now they didnt have a sign they did not ask me for money but you could just tell you could just tell that this poor family is dealing with life so i get inside and i said you know what i dont need anything to eat i really dont at this point its just the habit  i get to the register and i say you know what let me order some food for the family they got kids with them so i placed an order and the cashiers like anything else actually yes do you have um um wetnaps excuse me you know wetnaps to clean your hands sir youre more than welcome to use the restroom ill give you the code heres the thing its not for me its for the homeless family thats right outside the door i want to make sure that the little kids can clean their hands before they eat this food that i just ordered is for them and as were talkingthank you as were talking the manager at the mcdonalds is listening in to our conversation and she walks over and shes all nosy right shes like excuse me i couldnt help but overhear did you just say that this food is for the family outside  yeah i hope thats okay  no it is definitely okay giving food to people who need food is definitely okay however what you just called them is not okay   what did i call them  you said homeless  cause they are look shit  hes lickin the window   you cant say that word its considered offensive  who complained okay well if im not supposed to say the word homeless anymore what am i supposed to say instead of the word homeless  the new politically correct term is actually unhoused when describing someone in an unfortunate situation like that   youre kidding  no sir im not kidding and please lower your voice  you want me to lower my voice when youre saying something so ridiculous  if you think its ridiculous then clearly you are part of the problem not the solution  oh miami i wanted to get ghetto  i wanted to get ghetto oh yeah oh yeah i wanted to go full hialeah on them   love you fluffy thank you for coming hialeah  so yeah i wanted to go off on her but i i i wanted to get ghetto but i couldnt because that is the regular mcdonalds i go toyou know what im saying im not trying to get banned the next ones far and gas is a bitch so im like nah so i looked at her and i said okay were gonna play this game lets play this game from now on im no longer fat  according to you i am now unexercised   i did bro she looked at me and shes like dont be ridiculous and i looked at her and i was like oh oh well if you think its ridiculous then clearly you are part of the problem not the solution  and i grabbed the food and i walked out now second half of the story i walk over to the family mkay and i hand the bags of food to the mom and the mom was so nice she was just happy that someone thought of her and her kids she got very emotional shes like i just want to say thank you you have no idea what youre doing for us right now this really means a lot thank you and i had to ask the question  i said are you okay i know what you thought some of you are like dont do it oh i did it thats why were here watch so i looked and i said are you okay and she was like no unfortunately were not okay were not weve been homeless now for four days and i was like um  i dont know if you heardbut uh no not i didnt correct her  i didnt correct her cause im not a dick thats why i didnt correct her  thats what i mean you guys even if you have good intentions nowadays people can take what youre saying or doing and twist it to make you look bad there should be no consequences for being kind for trying to help for wanting to do the right thing for caring unfortunately were still consumed by this word called liability that sometimes we forget to be a little human and thats unfortunate im not trying to get on a soapbox about this im trying to let you know some things ive been dealing with and im just here to report  the thing with me now is that after  years of being a comedian every time i walk out the door the light is officially on in the sense that every time i leave my house there is a slight chance i could make the news for example did martin talk about how uh he fell off the stage earlier in the show yeahokay okay cool uh for the home audience martin he fell a while back he talked about it i know you didnt see it cause your subscription only covers so muchum yeah you can watch the first half on prime i think its on prime maybe you can just see it there then come back and check out the rest so long story short we were doing a show in phoenix arizona and martin accidentally fell off of a stage this high and he broke his foot now the incredible part about martin is that he got up and on adrenaline ran around got back up on stage and performed and then was taken to the hospital after he walked off stage he is a professional  seriously that is a pro much respect cause if it would have been me  if i wouldve fallen off stage and the staff was like what about the fans well bye felicia  what do we tell em refund  but see the difference is martin had to tell you he fell for you to know he fell and by the way i saw the fall i saw he came out and just kind of tripped over a cord backstage came through the curtain already you know and then you know martiiin  women in the front row were like he fell for me  im glad you laughed i said that last night and some guy was like aw  i said why aww  well thats your friend  exactly thats why i make fun of him that is the mark of a true friendship is being able to say real evil things about each other  because you know you dont really mean it plus you dont think that if i wouldve fallen off the stage instead of martin that he wouldntve had a joke you better believe he would have had a joke he would have told people i saw fluffy bouncenot to mention the fact that you know thatll make the news i fall off the stage tonight therell be a van out in front in an hour were standing here live in front of the hard rock hotel and casino where authorities believe fluffy lost control lets go to tom whos inside the venue who can fill us in with more thats right jim im standing here at the hard rock hotel and casino inside the venue where apparently fluffy took a spill it is still uncertain as to what happened here tonight we did have a chance to interview local authorities who had this to say damn  it is still uncertain if there was any problems with the stage we did speak to security who had this to comment i saw the whole damn thing okay whoo fluffy fell he fell hard i aint seen that many white people cry since a taylor swift concert it was bad it was bad and in miami are you kidding me he hurt more cubans than castro  and thats how you get canceled so uh thats the point im trying to make here i made the news recently uh without giving too much away theres an episode of family feud coming out very soon that im gonna be on yeahit is the celebrity edition so its fluffy and fluffys family versus fat joe  and his family so yeah its fat joe versus fluffy because apparently the producers have a great sense of humor  long story short i flew in some family from the east coast to be on the show the show went over very well youll find out who wins later heres the deal the next day my sister who was one of the people i flew in she hadnt been in california in forever and she was like can we go to disneyland and im like sure lets go so it was her and her husband gordy and i took them to disney and we get on a couple of rides and just so were clear thats not what made the news  i said that last night someone was like cause he fit nosome people right yeah we get on the cars ride at california adventure and halfway through the cars ride the car  stops on the track and my sister looked at me she goes is this supposed to happen i go no the check cleared were supposed to finish this is uh we paid its supposed to work no this it took the disney people about  minutes to come get us and take us out of the car so were sitting there outside in the sun for  minutes i had no problem with that because i am mocha im okay in the sun for  minutes my sister shes twice as dark as me shes like freaking you know apache shes you know freaking azteca  just you know her husband on the other hand hes from minnesota  he almost diedoh don cha know yeah so while were sitting there in the car waiting for the disney people to come take us out of the car the people waiting in line realize that the ride has been shut down and so from the ride you can see the line people see the car on the track and then they see whos in the car  and all of a sudden cell phones start comin out and by the time we left disney tmz had already reported the story and you can google this okay tmz reported the story before we left the park it said fluffy stuck on la freeway at disney  i thought it was cute i thought it was silly i thought it was funny i thought it was okay until i read the comments  oh some of you are dicks  one lady wrote just cause youre tall enough to ride doesnt mean youre small enough to fita guy wrote the car got tired  another guy wrote youre mexican couldnt you fix it  and that was martin yeah so   anyway so the time before that we made world news some of you might remember this story the guys and i were involved in an emergency landing situation i had uh chartered a private jet because my last netflix special the money finally hit my account and i you know freakin i thought i was yknow ballin right nope turns out we were fallin worst turbulence we have ever experienced in  years of being comedians uh worst turbulence i ever felt for sure at one point the jet did this i did this the scariest part was watching my dogs leave the seat fortunately we landed safely we were okay thats not what made the news what made the news is that when we came in for the landing the jet touched down and then it skid off the runway by  yards and we ended up in a field a field a field are you kidding me as hard as i work   to break stereotypes  a bunch of mexicans ended up in a field yeah thats what happenedthats how tmz reported it mexicans found in field  in the movies the pilots are always the first to know when theres an issue and in the movies the pilots always have the courtesy of telling the passengers they love to hear themselves talk they get on the mic all right its your captain speaking here i just want to let you know well be experiencing rough air if you could just fasten your seatbelts were gonna be aokay all right  you know if it gets bumpy you know   its your captain speaking somebody just had a little mexican food here so we were feeling a little bumpy up here we just had some fast food just a reminder to keep your seat belts fastened we might be getting a bit there we go just a bit there  all right ill be back with you in just a few seconds  if the planes going down brace for impact hold on tight were comin in hot our pilot nadaour pilot didnt say anything until we came to like a complete stop and then maybe like a minute later the cockpit door opened up and he stuck his head in and hes like you good  i was like my chihuahuas in a cup holder i am not good it was a scary situation you guys but let me tell you even though we were involved in an emergency landing and we thought we were gonna die im grateful for the experience believe it or not im grateful because it reminded me how valuable life is and how quickly things can changeevery now and then we need a little reminder we need to get shaken up a little to remind ourselves oh my god this is special this is important enjoy it have fun the rest of the day after the landing there was nothing anybody could tell me to ruin how good i felt to just be breathing and be alive nothing  and so thats why i uh im grateful for bad moments and i think bad moments are actually a good thing because we need balance in life you need to have bad experiences in order to truly appreciate good experiences not every day can be the same  you need to have a way to ba\\u2013 now dont get me wrong sometimes theres too many bad days in a row that shit sucks and thats actually what happened to me after the neardeath experience i go home i go home to find out that someone broke into my house  yeah yeah im like are you kidding me thats why i survived to see this shit  the only reason why you havent heard about it until now is because the detective whos working the case told me im not allowed to talk about it in californiayeah if the guys that broke into my house are here tonight  bravo  bravo thats a flex and a half no they broke into my house and of course the number one question is what did they take from your house and what they took from me honestly it was my peace of mind i didnt feel safe in that house after uh but if you must know i did everything to prevent a breakin i had first of all a good neighborhood i had an alarm i had two camera systems i had a fence that surrounded the property i thought i was good um i got video footage of the entire robberyin   oh that shit is crisp i saw the guys that broke in but i could not identify them because they were wearing masks all i can tell you about the two guys that broke into my house is that they were  years old i know they were  because when they jumped the fence and hit the ground no painif that wouldve been a  with messedup sciatica hed have thought twice about that fence so they jumped the fence went in the backyard and they broke the window and got in through the kitchen they trashed my house okay every drawer open every cabinet open everything got pulled out onto the floor so they could sift uh couches were flipped over cushions were thrown down and they pulled every single frame off the wall and i asked the detective i said hey look i understand the drawers the cabinets and even the couch thing but whats the story with the frames on the wall why did they take everything off the wall but didnt take any frames some of that stuff was art  mr iglesias you have to understand something about these people that broke into your home they were not looking for photos or art they were actually looking for a safe i said a safe  yes sir a safe a lot of times in these homes people will put a hole in the wall install a safe and then theyll hang a frame over the safe to disguise that their valuables are in there i said a safe sir yes a safe  but i just got this money  did they check the mattress   dont know  lets find out so we walk into the master bedroom i grab the edge of the bed right and i picked it up and i was like ah stupid  its all here oh my god these guys had no idea they were robbing somebody more ghetto than them  so at the end of it they only got a couple of little trinkets from the drawers um and thats pretty much it they made a mess of the house they didnt get any of the money ill tell you what they did get they got my guns  now i have never been open about the fact that i am in fact a registered gun ownerrelax florida  ive never been open about it because quite frankly its nobodys business okay however it does pertain to the story that im about to share with you um i am a recent gun owner i became a gun owner in  mkay uh yeah when we were in the middle of  it  every morning watching the news we didnt know what was gonna happen and it started to feel irresponsible not preparing myself for a worstcase situation every morning watching the news it felt like we were headed towards the purge  some of you are laughing but think about this the purge would have taken less time  yeah the purge thats how they shouldve woke us up at least for entertainment purposes   id like to thank you for your participation in the pandemic the local time is  am fear is why i decided to buy a gun i was afraid and i got no problem saying that i was scared we didnt know what was gonna happen um its only for protection i dont hunt i dont want to hunt i dont need to i know where theres three chickfilas  im good i dont go out on the weekends you know pull  theres no  i still own a nintendo i dont need that shit fear is the only reason why i decided to buy a gun so i wound up at this sporting goods store right by my house i walk in there and this place is packed full of people that normally would not have been open to the idea of owning a gun but they felt like me they were scared and rightfully so i kept hearing the same conversation over and over and over i kept hearing this i would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it   and i dont care where youre from that makes a lot of sense and i was not about to let politics interfere with my personal safety so next thing you know  so next thing you know i got in line i had to get a ticket with a number like when youre at the dmv or meat market  the butcher shop the bodega number five  i got in line fortyfive minutes i waited in line and as soon as i get to the front this guy comes to the counter and hes like  how can i help you son  well um by the way i heard some of you chuckle and just so were clear im not saying that all people  who sell gunstalk like that  but his name was jim  so jim was like how can i help you son well im here to see about purchasing my first firearm well youve come to the right place know what you want or you need a hand  ive had some time to look at your selection and i think i found something thats gonna work for me  all right show me what you got okay right over here in the case this one yeah right here this one the one right here in the front this one no not that one this one this one no this one not that one this one no the one in front with the tag the tag right here the one that says twotwo   um sir did you just call that gun a tutu   yeah what ji jim right jim jim dont look at me like im crazy dude im just reading the tag it says it right here in the front it says twotwo  you mean a   well yeah i guess twotwo  same thing  son i hate to break it to you but theres a big difference between a tutu and a  but hey this is california so whatever floats your boat son all right  now is there any particular reason why you have selected a uh a tutu   well um as impressive as your selection of guns here is i recognize a lot of them from movies its a bit much for me um im very simple um this gun looks very manageable its small and you know it looks easy plus its on sale you know what i mean come on man a guns a gun right not exactly  is this not a good choice  son you want my opinion or you want to buy and be done with it  no please tell me if im making a mistake is is a a  a good gun or a bad gun  son in my personal opinion youre better off tickling him as far as im concerned  all youre gonna do is aggravate the situation youre just gonna piss him off is what im trying to tell you  well listen to my thought process my whole idea for the gun is im gonna use the gun more so like as a deterrent so if somebody breaks into the house theyre gonna see this big bald mexican holding a gun and then theyre gonna think twice and then rob my neighbors instead  son if somebody breaks into your house and they have a gun theyre gonna know youre holding a  and ill tell you whats gon happen theyre gon take it from ya  and theyre gonna beat the holy hell outta you with it right and the beating youre gon get from a  is gonna hurt a hell of a lot more than the bullets out of a  thats for damn sure  now listen i dont know you but i think i know your situation and correct me if im wrong you want to protect your home  yes  your family  yes  your valuables  yes  all right follow me i think i got just what you need right here mkay you see this right here this heres a  millimeter to startokay a  millimeter is a solid firearm two to the chest that man is going down ten out of ten  however i got this special militarygrade ammunition over here i got this here bullet its called a spreader yeah its what i used to call my ex  she was a real pistol too let me tell you thats why i had to move to california shell never find me here so this bullet when it comes out the chamber it opens up and when it hits itll leave a hole about yay big and stupid me i said this i said people survive that survive survive son you dont want em to survive you want em dead as fried chicken as far as im concerned  i said i dont want anybody to die  you dont want anybody to die you guys hear that you hear that he dont want anybody to die yeah oh yeah you know who he voted for   look here tutu youre stressin me the hell out man i wanna help you but you gotta want to help yourself so listen imma do everything in my power to get through this um imma paint a picture for you mkay youre home someone breaks into your home they have a gun you have a gun you have already told this person to leave or you will shoot and theyre not leavin matter of fact theyre doing the opposite theyre getting closer and closer and closer and closer now theyre so close you can see the whites of their eyes this individual is standing directly in front of you you can see each other this individual is prepared to do whatever it takes to leave with whatever they want including taking your life my question to you is are you prepared to do the same are you willing to protect your family your home your valuables and most importantly yourself in this situation what are you gonna do first of all bro  you should sell like life insurance man cause  youre missing your calling i felt that i felt it um if im cornered like that and i have absolutely no choice and my life is in danger i promise you jim i will step up man and i will shoot them right in the leg i will   you think youre gonna hit the leg mr firsttime gun owner  hey if i buy that bullet youre trying to sell me that covers that much up close i can hit a leg two steps closer ill shoot him in the huevos i will dude ill hit a pelota i will no more babies man  all right all right you dont gotta get graphic on me now son you know whats gonna happen if you shoot someone in your home in the leg and they live  yeah i know im gonna sleep better knowing i didnt take a life and i was able to protect my home my family and my stuff thats whats gonna happen  ah clearly youre a disney fan   thats about the biggest fantasy ive ever heard right there son i would ask you if you knew but clearly you dont so im not gonna waste my time spinnin my wheels on this one im just gonna call it like it is if you shoot someone in your home and they live they can come back and sue your ass thats right now heres the kicker theyre gonna win thats right theyre gonna win and not only are they gonna get everything they wanted to get when they first broke in when its all said and done you are gonna cut them a big fat check now what do you got to say about that i said that motherfuckers gonna diehe got excited  now were talkin i found out something that day i found out that people that sell guns are a lot like people that sell used cars they play on your emotions and then they start to upsell you and make you buy things you dont want or need he knew i was scared because he kept saying it to me  i know youre scared youre scared and your fears youre worried youre scared every time hed say scared something else appeared on the counter  he sold me so well that when he was done selling me i wound up with four rifles  and four handguns and a case a case of spreader ammunition  i hear some of you clapping and why its excessive i only have two hands  see i feel again even though my home was burglarized i feel grateful because i wasnt there and i had my dogs with me i cant replace my dogs i cant replace me  stuff is stuff however if i would have been home i would have done whatever i needed to do thats the difference in this situation theres two kinds of people one people like me had the guns had the ammo glad they werent there but if they were there they wouldve done something about it cause if i was in bed and i heard the  i wouldve jumped up  i wouldve grabbed my gun  i wouldve ran out into the living room with no shirt on and one sock offid have confronted the person freeze knowing my luck   fluffy  i said freeze  oh youre funny youre funny bro youre funny  get on the ground  oh  dont make me shoot you  ah hey  hey beto get in here get in here youll never guess whose house this is the other guy runs in  oh hey oh hey oh hey oh hey i grew up watching you  next thing you know im autographing things theyre about to take      so like i said in this situation i feel like theres two kinds of people one people like me had the guns had the ammunition glad they werent home but if they would have been home they would have done something about it thats one type of people the other kind of people are the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity tooh good youre here  the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to confront an intruder because you know you have way more guns and ammunition than they do and you are prepared for war  the kind of people who sit home at night in the living room in the dark holding their gun they leave the front door unlocked to make it easier  and people like that always have a friend either across the street or across town how is everything over there on your side  its all clear over here how about you yeah coast is clear tenfour out there this situation the breakin left me traumatized i couldnt go back to living in the house because i didnt feel safe its just me and two chihuahuas yeah thats it im no longer with my sons mom and my son lives with his mom so you know and by the way i told my son frankie what happened about the breakin and right away right away oh really theyre lucky i wasnt there  im like c\\u00e1lmate john wick  they wouldve kidnapped you i wouldve had to pay double to get you back i could not go back to living at the house again its just me so i put the house up for sale uh yeah i just couldnt and it was a big beautiful home that you guys helped pay for thank you  it was nice real nice freaking four bathrooms four bathrooms yeah one peniseven if i ran i couldnt you know i put the house up for sale and heres the dilemma that i faced i put it up for sale before i had a new place to live because i figured im on the road im always in a tour bus a plane a hotel always somewhere im on the go i was just trying to get ahead of it because when i first bought the house it was sitting on the market for almost two years so i thought i had time what happened was it sold like that because i had two people bidding on the house at the same time and they kept driving up the price and one of the people trying to buy the house he wanted all of my furniture and so my agent for the house goes gabriel this is crazy these two guys are bidding on your house and they want to give you way more than what youre asking one of them wants to give you an extra  for all of your furniture i suggest you take it and so i did i sold the house with everything except the mattress everything the problem is i dont have a house right now i dont have anywhere to live so technically im umfuck it im homeless i dont care  ill say it ill say it im not gonna be unhoused im homeless right now they cant cancel me what are they gonna do take my house i dont have one ha  so whatever mm but no at this point at at  years of age i dont need more stuff im happy that i do have stuff but i dont need it what i want more than anything else now is better relationships better friendships better people in my life thats what i want more than anything else i announced in my last special at dodger stadium that i was no longer in a relationship and i thought that was the best place to announce that because ive been very open about my life my whole show is my life people kept asking about her so i thought that was the best place to announce that you know what happens when you tell  people at a stadium that youre single and then netflix airs that around the world i received thousands of applications for the fluffy fulfillment center yes i did   thats right netflix fluffy is hoein out  it was incredible it was exciting it was overwhelming and it was terrifying because i didnt know what they wanted um well im gonna tell you that since announcing that i was single ive gone out on a few dates and uh yeah i dont want to say how many cause i dont want your judgment  fluffys a whore  hes nasty  hes like santa with all his ho ho hos yeah i still want to go out i still want to have fun i want to make connections but unfortunately i dont trust people im afraid i can meet people really easy but then i find out what theyre up to and that sucks um my heart is guarded now super guarded theres a wall and then a wall and then a wall and a wall and a wall im like the only mexican who likes wallsso moving forward i can tell you i dont want to be in another relationship im actually doing okay i still want to go out but i dont want to be in a committed relationship i i dont no what do you mean boo the fact that im being honest about that i dont want to be in a relationship i think

guess what youre not the only ones you see that couple over there that couple is celebrating  years of marriage today and were like what so we look i said how come theyre not talking   i wondered the same thing but the man made it a point to say  years i thought that was pretty impressive i go no it is so he leaves to go get us some sodas and some bread and i tell my manager i said hey joe listen imma go say hi to the couple real quick  dont get us kicked out  im not gonna  dont make it like last time  its not gonna be so i get up and i push in my chair and i make my way over to the couple now i understand how important this night is for them i know exactly how long it took to get to that point and i am not trying to mess that up but i have questions  and these two people are clearly professionals in that department so i approached the table as tactfully as i could and i said pardon the interruption it has come to my attention that we are celebrating  years of marriage and the man was so happy that someone acknowledged that he was just thrilled hes like   thats right son fiftyfive years ago today this lovely lady sittin next to me right here said i do and weve been together ever since  that is beautiful may i ask you a question  absolutely  how come youre not talking   he wants to know how come were laugh goddammitson when youve been together as long as the two of us have you mightve seen a thing or two uh uh we have children grandchildren greatgrandchildren we have traveled this great big world of ours many times over were both retired military we have seen the best in people and unfortunately when youre around and alive as long as the two of us have been uh youve unfortunately seen the worst in people as well we have had just about every type of conversation there is to have  at least twice  and after  years of marriage well hell were just trying to enjoy each others company even if its in silence i said youve had every type of conversation there is to have and i guess i triggered him because he was like look at me look at me ive been in combat nothing can faze me nothing can surprise me anymore you dont say so i took a step towards them i grab my shirt and i flash them  and then i walked away and you know what happened next they started talking  i gave that couple the greatest gift they will never ever acknowledge something new something spontaneous something outrageous something neither one of them had ever seen before i gave them a new story i promise you every year moving forward all theyre gonna talk about is what happened at   remember honey remember when that samoan flashed us  right cause im a giver i remember many many years ago before there was a venue like this to perform in the only place around here for comedians to do shows was at a comedy club right outside these doors that was part of the original layout of the casino  it was a club called the improv theres a chain all over  and you know many many years ago before all of this thats where martin and myself my buddy alfred wed go do shows at the at the club and the first time we got a chance to perform there i didnt really have a name i wasnt really established yet and i want to take this moment to acknowledge and thank one person who was super super helpful in that a man by the name of dj lazthats right people the pimp with the limp oh yeah pap\\u00e1 yeah its your boy dj laz i love him man hes great hes awesome but yeah he walks in circles he does he walks in circles nice guy dj laz was one of the first people to allow me to be on morning radio with him and he helped promote my shows not only would he allow me to go on his show and promote my shows he would come to my shows and he would bring people and hed watch and hed sit and hang out and laugh the man has a million things he can do in miami but hed come watch my show and then the next day pap\\u00e1 come on the radio with me were gonna talk about your show and he would help me sell out these shows year after year after year so laz i know youre watching pap\\u00e1 thank you this is part of you pap\\u00e1 muchas gracias thank you thank you but that was many years down the line in the beginning the first time i performed at that comedy club right outside these doors thats no longer there um im talking to the marketing person now keep in mind this is so long ago there was no social media there was no tiktok no freaking twitter no facebook none of that the only way you could promote yourself back then was you had to get on morning radio morning news have somebody do a writeup on you in the newspaper remember those yeah and then of course wordofmouth which is always the best uh they had posters at the comedy club and so the marketing guy goes gabriel help me help you help us we want to sell tickets how do you want to be promoted i said well keep in mind long time ago i said um this is how i want you to promote my show please use a photo under the photo put my name gabriel iglesias i didnt have the nickname fluffy yet thats how long ago this was i said underneath that please put as seen on comedy central because at the time that was the only television credit i had so the marketing guy goes well i was thinking what about gabriel iglesias and his amigos  amigos why amigos because i have other mexicans with me and he looked at me and said good you get it i dont like that what about gabriel iglesias and friends well we want to put a couple of buzzwords out there to let the community know what type of show it is i said what type of show is it  its a special show  i dont feel special  gabriel hear me out what about like a taco tuesday  i dont like it  okay what about salsa night  salsa night wait like dancing or chips and guac  either one i dont like it i could not believe i was having this conversation and i wanted to get upset i wanted to go off on this guy for trying to make me feel like less of a person right but i didnt because i knew that if i went off on them i would have been seen as difficult i would have been seen as a problem and i would not have been given another opportunity to come back when people ask me what do you credit for your success of course talent showing up doing what you gotta do but one word that gets left out a lot is the word sacrifice i had to sacrifice something that day and a lot of people think they know what sacrifice means but honestly until you have to make one i dont think you do i had to sacrifice my pride because as much as i wanted to go off on this guy i knew that if i did id be shooting myself in the foot i knew that if they could see what i could do on that stage theyd have to bring me back and theyd have to treat me differentso as much as it hurt as much as it sucked i allowed that stupid taco tuesday to happen so for me i was very upset i was wondering is this something that happens to all new comedians or was i being singled out it was killing me i needed to know i couldnt just take out my phone and google it because that wasnt an option all those years back so what i had to do was i had to go to the front door of the club where they had a bin and the bin had flyers in it so i grabbed the flyer and i looked at it and the flyer had the list of upcoming comedy shows and i was so upset when i saw it because all it was was pictures names and television credits no silly names no theme nights no spicy this or crazy that just comedy so i said why are they doing this stupid taco tuesday thing to me so i said let me try to find another comedian whos a little bit more in my vein if you know what i mean the only other comedian i could find was a man by the name of george lopezwith georges promo however it was just a picture name and underneath that a television credit that said as seen on abc thats it it didnt say likes to ride a donkey george lopez eats a burrito with both hands george lopez ay ay ay i just jumped the wall its george lopez no so i said why are they doing this to me so then i said all right all right let me see how they promote the black comedians and with the black comedians it was the same thing picture name television credit and thats it unless it was a show that had multiple black comedians on it because if the comedy club had a show with three or more black comics on it they would put a catchy name to it they would call the show urban night or apollo night or def jam comedy night bet comedy night blackish comedy night but thats as far as they would go they wouldnt go to the next level like they would for me oh yeah there was no margarita monday or taco tuesday or wetback wednesday or tortilla thursday or fiesta friday or s\\u00e1bado gigante no that would never happen to black people are you kidding me youll never see a malt liquor monday or tupac tuesday or watermelon wednesday or thong ththong thong thursday or fried chicken friday or sookiesookie saturday or slapaho sundayand that most definitely will not happen to white people     oh imma do the joke and you know why you can laugh and enjoy and not feel threatened by what im about to say because like what i said earlier tonight i am here to entertain i am not here to offend im here to have fun with everybody starting with me plus itll never happen youll never see a monster truck monday or trailer park tuesday or white trash wednesday or take your sister out thursday   oh hell no fluffy you done crossed the line now my name is dustin and i dont play that shitim from davie goddammit  next time stay quiet  so i was talking to martin backstage before i came out and he goes are you gonna share the story about the theme nights thing that happened at the improv here and yknow i go well yknow i think i should martin i think i should tell the story about yknow the theme nights he goes gabe can i tell you something about that theme nights bit i go tell me martin  do you realize that in all the years i have heard you tell this story about what happened at that club do you understand that youve never once finished the week  i said martin you know why that is right its the rule of comedy you always want to end on the biggest laugh thursday gets the biggest laugh which is why i stopped at thursday and martin goes i know i know i know but youre robbing white people of their week  i never looked at it that way fox news fridaystorm the capitol saturday  say youre sorry sunday  are we still havin a good time  are we still having fun  thats what im talkin about people laughing not getting upset not getting offended not freakin making a stink and let me tell you right now for the five people who have never heard of me before this is for you  i get pulled over one night two minutes after coming out of a krispy kreme drivethrough  i made a left turn instead of making a right turn but i wasnt paying attention cause i had a box right i was like oh youre gonna get it   youre gonna get it i make a wrong turn all of a sudden     later the officer is taking forever i said forget this i grab the box of donuts i put it on my lap i flipped it open i was like  mm  ah  and just as i was about to tear it up the officer gets to the window and hes like you know why i stopped you it was too easy i picked up the box and i said  cause you can smell it   fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy    youre probably wondering why did we pause the special again well i just want to let you guys know most comedians wouldve already said thank you good night gone home cashed their netflix checks and hope they get another phone call please call me netflix  but this guy is not most comedians thats what happens when you hire a mexican we love overtime  thank you for still wanting to hear a joke thats over  years old  i grew up watching you too  got chills when i  look look   that was beautiful i love you too and that seriously you guys thank you for that thank you  thank you there are fans and then theres what you just did right now  i dont know any other comedian that gets this type of love and loyalty thank you so much im not getting off the stage yet cause i still got more to go but i want to say thank you for that  thank you  whoo so when i started doing standup in  the only place that would allow me to go up on stage and do what i do were bars dive bars rough bars uh martin and i thats where we met many many years ago were performing at this bar in montebello california and uh you had to fight with the crowd you had to fight because there was noise there were tvs on people were drinking smoking people were doing everything in there but paying attention so you had to come out quick trying to get them to laugh and one night this comedian pulls me aside and he goes hey kid and when he called me kid i got upset im like i could drinki was   years old and you know even though i thought i was grown i wasnt i wasnt grown uh i got upset that he pulled me aside he goes can i give you some advice im like who does this guy think he is im funnier than him thats what i thought because at the age of  i was a punk i really was and so i dont know what got into me where i said sure ill hear you out and i just stood there and he said listen um youre really likeable on stage and thats rare im gonna give you a bit of advice if you cut all the cussing out of your show and start taking the filthy material out i think youre gonna have a long career ahead of you and i know i said take the cussing out and i i said the fword twice tonight  technically no three times i said it three times um but im mindful of it im keeping count its not every other word plus were in a casino  okay no one loses their ass and says aw shucks noi heard some of you cussing before when the fuck is this gonna start yeah i heard you i heard you  im fat not deaf  i heard you goddammit so anyway he gives me this advice cut the cussing out of your show take out the filthy material and i dont know why i listen but i did and he was absolutely right all of a sudden i started getting opportunities left and right i started getting booked at colleges high schools churches fairs and then the big one casinos   back in the day you had to be squeakyclean to perform at a casino uh but thats not the case anymore if you can sell tickets it doesnt matter what you do they want to book you but back in the day there was only a few people who could pull it off i was fortunate to be one of those people so i remember i got booked to perform at a casino called morongo in southern california and im backstage with the booker the lady that hired me for the function and she goes so no cussing right i go no no cussing  no filthy material  no filthy material  good luck and it was just me i didnt have openers it was just me it was a voiceover on the frickin speaker right ladies and gentlemen please welcome comedian funny man gabriel iglesias and then i just i walked out there right i offended the entire audience  in five seconds and i did it without cussing frickin  kid goes up on stage looks at the crowd and says hey everybody is this a regular casino or is this an indian casino  you see how you all knowi didnt know i didnt know because i didnt have tiktok to teach me  what i did have was a life experience that ill never forget as soon as i said that the entire front row which comprised of the tribal members from the casino they all stood up and one of them called me out in front of the entire audience hey hey you dont say that anymore the proper term is native american please show respect and i was like oh my god im so sorry i didnt know and i felt horrible and i was so embarrassed fortunately i had a second show at ten oclock ten oclock hits i take the stage i didnt need to be told a thousand times that i messed up that one time of me getting shamed in front of the entire audience was all i needed thats why im a firm believer in shaming  i think shaming is good shaming is good as long as you shame with purpose if youre about to teach someone a valuable lesson i say go for it because it worked for me i got shamed one time second show ten oclock i took the stage ooh it was different i was like before i get started ladies and gentlemen id like to take this opportunity to thank all of the native americans who are here tonight thank you for this opportunity to perform in your casino i hope you enjoy the performance  i thought i was good all of a sudden another tribal member in the back jumped up and hes like hey drop the american just say native kay  that stayed with me that was powerful that was scary next time i did a casino first thing i said was i would like to acknowledge all of the natives who are here tonight and then someone yelled out were indigenous fuck me thats four   with time i got a chance to perform all across the united states and then i get my firstever show in canada ironically enough at a casino  its a casino we still perform at called caesars in the city of windsor ontario right across the water from detroit michigan  i come to find out the hard way that in canada it is a completely different term for describing the people  originally from that land the proper term in canada is actually first nation i didnt know that i was so nervous being in canada i said native american  like hello im not even in america right frickin stupid right pendejo i know  fortunately someone pulled me to the side and they told me what was up i was lucky that i had a second show ten oclock i take the stage and im like before i begin i would like to acknowledge all of the first nation people who are here tonight then some guy yells out call us indians  this guy in the front row was like  theyre not indian they are not indian  canada has always been an adventure there was one show that we did at the same casino anytime now we perform outside of the united states even if its next door in canada or mexico martins first question to the audience is do we have any americans in the house tonight because no matter where we perform in the world theres always a handful so that night martin takes the stage and he asked the question do we have any americans here tonight not knowing that earlier in the day at that same casino in the grand ballroom there was a a endofyear holiday party from an american company from right across the water in detroit and they were having this endofyear celebration and they were there pregaming since noon  partying it up and i guess the the party planner for the event thought it would be an amazing idea to end their party with laughter so this person bought all of the tickets to my show that night and gave them to that company well seven oclock rolls around and everybody stumbles in takes their seats and then martin walks out and he asked the question do we have any americans and instead of getting a yay whoo right here he got  they were so drunk they started chanting usa usa usa usa im in the dressing room hearing this im like why are we herewe could have done this in detroit you know i had to fill out paperwork im like this is not cool so during intermission martin comes backstage and he tells me bro i dont know if you heard  oh i heard  might wanna mention it i go oh i will so at some point during my performance i told the audience so a little bird told me there might be a couple of americans here tonight is that true sure enough  and they started doing it again  usa usa usa then it got quiet and you could hear murica  i said ladies and gentlemen do you understand what just happened we just made history and people in the front row theyre like what are you talking about history i said we just made history who would have ever thought youd see the day where thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of americans would cross a borderto see a mexicanthank you for  years of supporting this mexican miami i love you so much many thanks have a good night thank you\\u266a i was down but now im up \\u266a \\u266a this all god this aint no luck \\u266a fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy fluffy

music out lets roll hold there lights do the lights thank you thank you very much i appreciate that i dont necessarily agree with you but i appreciate very much well this is a nice place this is easily the nicest place for many miles in every direction thats how you compliment a building and shit on a town with one sentence it is odd around here as i was driving here there doesnt seem to be any difference between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here people just kind of walk in the middle of the road i love traveling and seeing all the different parts of the country i live in new york i live in a\\u2013 theres no value to your doing that at allthe old lady and the dogi live\\u2013 i live in new york i always\\u2013 like theres this old lady in my neighborhood and shes always walking her dog shes always just\\u2013 shes very old she just stands there just being old and the dog just fights gravity every day just\\u2013 the two of them its really\\u2013 the dogs got a cloudy eye and shes got a cloudy eye and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together and\\u2013 and shes always wearing like this old sweater dress i guess it was a sweater when she was like  but now its just like this sweater and her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare theyre just white with green streaks and bones sticking out her legs are awful i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by and he was like yecch no thank you i do not want those id rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit i see these two all the time and i always look at them and i always think god i hope she dies first i do i hope she dies first for her sake because i dont want her to lose the dog i dont think shell be able to handle it if she dies\\u2013 if the old lady dies first im not worried about the dog because the dog doesnt even know about the old lady this dog is aware of three inches around his head hes living in twosecond increments the second hes in and the one he just left is all he knows about but if he dies this lady shes gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has and i know hes all she has because she has him theres no\\u2013 if she had one person in her life she would not keep this piece of shit little dog even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say good morning gladys shed be like good and just flush him down the toilet just\\u2013 poom poom the dog just keeps bumping on the drain poom  she gives up ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life ppp poommy daughter likes fishyou ever flush a pet down the toilet i had to flush my daughters fish down the toilet i came home the fish was dead she wasnt home from school yet so i just flushed the fish and thats a weird moment too cause fish live in water so you put it in the toilet floats to the bottom like yeah hes dead and then you flush and it looks like he goes wait a second aw shit i was taking a nap jesus you gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house and then my daughter comes home why did he die da\\u2013 come on what am i gonna say why did he die because who gives a shit thats the reason thats the actual reason is because didnt matter that he was alive thats why hes dead he didnt know his name and he didnt love you back these are the facts about that fishs life my daughter likes fish we took her to the aquarium i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston and we were looking at this seal or sea lion i dont know which one i dont care i dont think they need to be separate things i really dont they dont care and we dont care theres like three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say ok everybody from now on seals and sea lions and walruses and\\u2013you know what\\u2013penguins are all seals now and we would all be like yeah all right fine yes whatever man anyway so were looking at this sealsea lion thing and hes looking back at us through the plexiglas and hes going\\u2013 theyre really disgusting in person most animals are when you really see them you ever go to a farm you think youre gonna see little white sheep going baa but theyre all fat and shitcolored and theyre like\\u2013 jesus that thing is awful anyway seals dont go\\u2013 they go\\u2013 my daughters like what is he saying i dont know im a slave kill methe food chainmust be awful to be other kinds of stuff you know im glad im this this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives anything else any other kind of thing youre in the food chain youre in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain i dont know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing life ends by being eaten thats how all life ends is\\u2013 every single life except human life every life ends like this aah aah aah were the only ones that get to just die old in a bed just i love you bye i mean imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else imagine if we were in the food chain it would just be another thing you gotta deal with youre already having a bad day you wake in up in the morning youre making breakfast you burn your toast and its too late to try again and your kid comes in and says beh and youre like fine and its just why you get a thing in the mail that says that your phones different and your mortgage is another company now what i dont get it then youre walking to work like why do i even bother shit goddamn it theres always fucking cheetahs at the train station stop it you think that sharks\\u2013 do you think that sharks would be embarrassed if they knew that we could all see their fins sticking out the top of the water i think theyd be bummed cause i dont think sharks are aware of that at all i think sharks think theyre slick they swim around like hey nobody has any idea whats down here and were all up here like theres totally a shark right there it wouldnt be fun being a predator either if youre a predator imagine if every time youre hungry you gotta chase a guy whos running for his life you gotta\\u2013 come on dude shit get over here and just hold him down and bite his neck till he shuts the fuck up for a minute so you can just sit there and eat his stomach before you go to work that would really suck thats why animals just\\u2013 they go lets do this together man you chase the parents away i am gonna eat the kid and you circle back thats why they do it like that fuck it im eating babies this is bullshit grownups aint worth the meat whoops all right all right shit goddamn it idiot this isnt a gay voice by the way its not shut up yeahcourtyard confrontationi live in new york city and its ok there i live in a nice building i never lived in a nice place before when i was growing up i had no money i mean my mom didnt didnt matter i was a child but im not used to it cause its nice theres like a pretty courtyard with flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing i dont know what is it with fountains like all fountain sculptors are pedophiles basically you cant get a fountain

it was a sunday morning thats my least presentable hour theres a lot of you know just stains just like you know food and me and whatever and so im sitting there so shut up ha ha ha anyway but so there i was im sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard and feeling a little out of place you know theres these fancy doormen and stuff and then theres this guy looking at me i notice hes looking at me from across the courtyard and hes all spiffylooking hes got brown shoes and hes looking at me like  i can tell he was thinking i dont live in the building he thinks i just wandered in off the streets and sat in the courtyard i can tell hes thinking of coming over and dealing with me on his own and im sitting there thinking like please do that yes please come on come on come on come on come on and im trying to look even more gross and im like pulling up my shirt  and then i see him go no thats not gonna do at all and he comes over to me  and im like num num num im so excited to have this thing a confrontation where im not wrong at all and he thinks i am rrgh so he comes over says excuse me do you live in this building and i said no cause why not start there i said no he goes well then what are you doing here and i said i just need to rest im having a hard time he says this is private property and i said well i dont really believe in that you know just the worst things i could say from his point of view is basically all the things i was saying and he goes well if you dont leave im gonna talk to the doorman i was like can i just stay like five more hours so hes\\u2013no and he goes

television me and those few people that clapped we saw the president of america cry and then quit being the president that shit was crazy cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next today people

life betteri like getting older though because for me the kind of guy i am getting older makes my life better you know like my sex life way better at  look cause this situation is ok at  this is not a fun kind of a  to be and some people their life is better when theyre younger you know young dudes young skinny dudes best life in the world is being a young skinny dude they dont have to do anything they just show up with a big adams apple and a smelly tshirt hey im here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life so where do i\\u2013 everywhere ok cool but for guys like me this is not a fun youth it gets better id like to make one of those it gets better ads for just dumpy young guys we could use a little help a little encouragement just somebody on tv listen man i know its tough right now youre vaguely heavy with no face you have zero value on the sexual marketplace you feel invisible to the girls in school because you are but it gets better because youll all grow up and you pretty much look just like this your whole life and they dont their options start running out really fast and youre gonna be there as long as you stay relatively employed and washed youre gonna be amazing in your  youre gonna be\\u2013 youre gonna be the branch that she can grab before she hits the ground its gonna be so great it just takes time for her circumstances to match your looks but its gonna happen its gonna happen when real shit matters youre gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world its just time thats all it takes theres a formula to this its pussy plus time over income squaredeverybody has their timeeverybody has their time everybody has their time i mean not everybody there are people out there who theres just nobody for them yep people like to say things like theres someone for everyone nope not at all true and stop saying it cause its mean to people who never find anybody there are millions of people out there who weve all unanimously decided they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips even nobody touches their genitals their entire life they just wash it and then they die thats all that happens aww and if youre feeling bad for them you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart aww well go fuck one nah i didnt think so thats the one way were all mean nobody does that nobody fucks down nobody people fuck up or across some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up some guy yeah no you should im totally up yeahdating takes courageits a weird selection process that we have dating really is\\u2013 its how we evolve is dating its how we choose each other and dating is a real drag for a lot of people but i always think its a nice thing you know when i see a date im always happy when i see a couple on a date cause it means people are still trying you know you see a couple on a date it means theres still courage out there that takes courage to go on a date for both sides two very different kinds of courage the male courage traditionally speaking is that he decided to ask he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if shes gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified everything in your body is telling you just go the fuck home and jerk off dont do this but he walked up and said hi yes and shes like  no no no a second give me a second and you try to get through this membrane of you know\\u2013 and then if it works and you say you wanna go out sometime sometimes shell say yes and if she says yes thats her courage and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and illadvised and the whole species existence counts on them doing it and i dont know how they\\u2013 how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men were the numberone threat to women globally and historically were the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to women were the worst thing that ever happens to them thats true you know what our numberone threat is heart disease thats the whole thing thats it just our own heart going dude i cant\\u2013 you cant keep doing this i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart but women still\\u2013 yeah ill go out with you alone at night what are you nuts ill get in your car with you with my little shoulders hi where are we going to your death statistically how do they still do it if youre a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and youre like i hope this ones nice i hope he doesnt do what hes going to dofirst datei always\\u2013 i love when i see a date you know when you see a date you can tell its the first date cause of the way theyre walking together and shes looking up at his face trying to figure him out and hes just a mess a guy on a first date just has no actual personality hes just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each just anything no cohesive\\u2013 just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines just you know well ha ha well yes i think so too ha ha rrgh whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date thats later down the line and something has happened theres something that happens in a date that i never get to witness cause women do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly im gonna let him fuck me they just get to decide something he says and shes like that was good hes gonna fuck me later and he has no idea hes still like trying all this shit he still has no idea hes already in theretitsguys are\\u2013 we love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 and we just look at you thats what i do i just look at women i just\\u2013 like theyre you know cakes in windows i just\\u2013 i was walking in new york once and theres these two very cute women walking behind me and i was trying to walk slowly so i could hear what they were saying to each other you know cause they were cute so i wanted to hear them like thats gonna help me in any way to hear their\\u2013 dont you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for like one second ok here here i go thank you its really a flaw in men that we would all do that if youre a woman you could ask any guy on planet earth could you squeeze my tit for one second and  of us will go yes of course that doesnt matter i could be doing open heart surgery yeah ok beep dont worry hes not your tits dont worry about it i dont know why we love tits so much some people say its because we breastfeed but so do women or you know baby women not grownup women dont usually\\u2013 you dont see like a  woman like a stately look\\u2013 you know like sigourney weaver like sucking milk out of a young womans tit thank you deborah ill see you tomorrow at  its not usually the thing is the elderly breastfeeding from the young except for at the end of the grapes of wrath which i dont mean to ruin that book for you but you should have read it by now i dont know if you read the grapes of wrath but thats how it ends with an old dying man sucking milk out of a young girls tits and then the book is over and youre like jesus what happened at the end there thats crazy theres no other book in that genre theres no dense historic classic that ends with a weird porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 and then anna karenina shat on his chest holy moly with that the end my god that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book ive been reading this book for three months but we do we love tits and you always know a tit you always know a tit you know like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 like a subway or like you know a sports stadium\\u2013 and youre smooshed in with other people and your elbow touches a tit behind you youre like thats a tit i just touched it i know that was a tit i know it because the sensitivity of the male elbow to tit flesh specifically is unbelievable just to tits cause you could drive a tack in there im not gonna feel it but a tit\\u2013 through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket and her jacket sweater shirt and bra somehow its a tit i touched a tit i touched a tit i touched one tit one tit thats rare to touch one tit its like a fourleaf clover usually you touch two the only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident or you didnt have permission but otherwise when tit access is granted its usually good for two tits at a time its once youre on one\\u2013 you really have to screw up really badly and quickly to lose tit access between tits one and two you must have said something really dumb on the first tit that you didnt get the second one yeah its like your moms dirty whore tit why what i said i liked it thats what i meant is that i like it i like your moms dirty whore tit and i like yours and if its up to the guy were gonna touch both tits no guy touches a tit and then goes you know what im good with the one thats fine for me everything in moderation were gonna touch both even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 yeah\\u2013 theres a bomb shit come on lets get\\u2013 come on lets get your tits out of heredivorceive seen a few tits ive seen\\u2013i dont know\\u2013  maybe i dont know i had my history in my life you know ive been divorced for five years and its been the best part of my life being divorced easily my favorite part of my life i love being divorced every year has been better than the last that is the only time i can say that about and by the way im not saying dont get married if you meet somebody fall in love and get married and then get divorced because thats the best part its the best part marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness which is divorce because you just let go and everythings fine now divorce is forever it really actually is marriage is for how long you can hack it but divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak nobody ever says  my divorce is falling apart its over i cant take it and again if youre in a good marriage stay in it if youre in the best marriage ever stay in it im just saying if you got out it would be better thats just a fact im sorry im sorry but its true everythings better my exwife and i this is the best part of our knowing each other were good coparents because we live apart and were friends our kids go to her half the week they come to me half the week and im a good father im an attentive focused and responsible father do you know why cause i get to say goodbye to these kids every week are you shitting me its like every parents fantasy who cant be a good father for half of every week no matter how bad it gets every wednesday i get to go goodbye girls daddys gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now im gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here thats why im such a good dadvideoing your kidsmy daughter was having a dance thing at her school they had this big dance anyway we all went all the parents and everybodys there and everybodys got their phone every single parent it was an amazing thing to watch cause kids are dancing and every parent is standing there like this every single person was blocking their vision of their actual child with their phone and the kids\\u2013 i went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 theres people holding ipads in front of their faces it looked like were all in the witness protection program like the kids cant see their parents and everybodys watching a shitty movie of something thats happening ten feet\\u2013 like look at your fucking kid the resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look its totally hd why are you taping this youre never gonna watch it in a million years youre not gonna watch videos of your kids doing shit you missed the first time it happened you dont watch it you just put it on facebook here you watch it i wanna take a nap now and then you get to read all the comments my god its so cute ngaah and guess what theyre not watching it either theyre not watching the video these kids are dancing for no one nobody watches the videos on your facebook they see the first frame of a kid and they go thats very nice ok back to this nobodys watching your kids videos on facebook i promise you ill prove it to you next time you tape your kids dance tape one second of it and then add  minutes of just your own asshole just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for  minutes tack it onto your kid dancing for a second put that on facebook everybody will write the same thing thats adorable i think i see a future starlife is a good dealdont tape shit on your\\u2013 life is short life is very short i like life i like it i feel like even if it ends up being short i got lucky to have it cause life is an amazing gift when you think about what you get with a basic life not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life if you have a life thats an ama\\u2013 heres your boilerplate deal with life this is basic cable what you get when you get life you get to be on earth first of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location this is earth and for trillions of miles in every direction it fucking sucks so bad its so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head cause it sucks so bad you get to be on earth and look at shit as long as youre not blind or whatever it is you get to be here you get to eat food you get to put bacon in your mouth i mean when you have bacon in your mouth it doesnt matter whos president or anything you just\\u2013 every time im eating bacon i think i could die right now and i mean it thats how good life is you get to\\u2013 you get to fuck thats free if youre smart that comes with thats part of the deal where else are you gonna get that deal you get to put your dick in there and go in and out pretty good and if youre a woman you get to just lay back and just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly anytime you want anytime you want if youre a gay man you get to just fill your boyfriends ass with your dick just fill it all the way to the balls and its nice and warm and tight in there and hes your buddy if youre a lesbian you get to do all the stuff theyre doing and its a great deal you get to eat you get to fuck you get to read to kill a mockingbird its a great life so you know im not worried about it endingbehind the wheelits pretty good and ive wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i dont know you know its amazing how nasty we can get as people depending on the situation like most people are ok as long as theyre ok but if you put people in certain contexts they just change like when im in my car i have a different set of values i am the worst person i can be when im behind the wheel which is when im at my most dangerous when youre driving thats when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons and yet its the worst people get and i am the worst one time i was driving and there was a guy ahead of me and he kind of\\u2013i dont know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second and this came out of my mouth i said worthless piece of shit i mean what an indictment what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being worthless piece of shit thats somebodys son and things ive said to other people i was once driving and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 i dont remember even\\u2013 and i yelled out my window i said hey fuck you where outside of a car is that even nearly ok if you were in an elevator and you were like right next to a persons body and whatever like he leaned into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go hey fuck you worthless piece of shit no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you theres nothing you would not say to them i hope you die i said that to a person i hope you die why cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life you tested my reflexes and it worked out fine so now i hope your kids grow up motherless i mean what am i capable of id like to think that im a nice person but i dont know manif murder was legala lot of it is context theres a lot of things i wonder if the world was different like if murder was legal i might have killed a few people i dont know id love to think i would never do that but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder is the numberone thing preventing murder wed like to think its cause like i would never do that no its cause it really sucks getting caught murdering a lot if murder was legal or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 shit they had a camera there well if murder was legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderers would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you wouldnt trust somebody who didnt murder if murder was legal you wouldnt like them i never killed anybody ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep i mean not even a hooker live a life whats wrong with that guy hes like a mormon or some shit i hate those guys i think hes nice shut up janet they would just\\u2013 if murder was legal there would be a lot of murder children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids thats mostly what would happen if murder was legal you know youd go to a mall thered be like eight different moms in the mall just\\u2013 i told you to stop it you didnt listen to me just\\u2013pbbt thered be just\\u2013 youd be stepping over dead kids thered be like a new problem you have to clean up your kids when you kill them cause its gross its bad for the environment if you murder your child in a public place please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers every three feet of america put your murdered child in the red bag with a logo of a murdered kid on it next to the other logo that tells you not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave them in the bag that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row right in a row that is a compressed area of bad thoughtof course but maybeyou know you have your bad thoughts hopefully you do good things everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts hopefully the good thoughts win for me i always have both i have like the thing i believe the good thing\\u2013 thats the thing i believe\\u2013 and then theres this thing and i dont believe it but it is there its always this thing and then this thing its become a category in my brain that i call of course but maybe ill give you an example ok like of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected of course we have to segregate their food from nuts have their medication available at all times and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies of course but maybe maybe if touching a nut kills you youre supposed to die of course not of course not of course not jesus i have a nephew who has that id be devastated if something happened to him but maybe maybe if we all just do this for one year were done with nut allergies forever no of course not of course if youre fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt its a terrible tragedy of course of course but maybe maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot its not that weird maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at its a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened listen listen you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts for kids dying from nuts you applauded so youre in this with me now do you understand you dont get to cherrypick those kids did nothing to you of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened of course it is every time its happened\\u2013 black people in america jews in egypt every time a whole race of people has been enslaved its a terrible horrible thing of course but maybe maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves every single thing where you go how did they build those pyramids they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just threw chinese people in caves and blew em up and didnt give a shit what happened to them theres no end to what you can do when you dont give a fuck about particular people you can do anything thats where human greatness comes from is that were shitty people that we fuck others over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where theyre making these they jump off the fucking roof cause its a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d\\n\\u266a A whole new world \\u266a\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore.\\nI\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d\\nI can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I\\u2019ve been Ali Wong.

From recounting his experiences with fame and evolving societal norms to navigating personal milestones like his relationships and the challenges of maintaining his authenticity, Iglesias crafts a deeply engaging narrative. The special reflects his belief in staying true to his comedic roots\\u2014focusing on entertainment without alienation\\u2014while touching on personal growth, his rise to international fame, and the enduring loyalty of his fans. Through hilarious retellings of real-life situations, including a robbery, his missteps in cultural sensitivity, and navigating life post-breakup, Iglesias showcases his ability to laugh at himself and find humor even in adversity. The show is a testament to his longevity, adaptability, and connection with audiences, offering both laughs and introspection.\\n* * *\\n[crowd cheering]\\n[crowd chanting]\\nFluffy!\\n[cheering stops]\\n[Gabriel] Man, look at this crowd.

They\\u2019re like, [in Spanish] \\u201cI\\u2019m blind!\\u201d [in English] \\u201cIt\\u2019s too much.\\u201d Ah, freaking Mexican DJ Khaled up here. I know, right? Also, I would like to thank, since we\\u2019re here, Only in Dade. Thank you so much. If you know, you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] \\u2026and I think you know. [crowd chuckles] And also, to my friends over at La Carreta for all the food. So\\u2026\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYes. [laughing] Yeah, man. Before we get started, you guys, uh, I would like to thank the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino for the opportunity to record a special. No other entertainer has done a special here yet. Tonight is the first one.\\n[crowd cheering]\\nIt wasn\\u2019t the Rolling Stones. It wasn\\u2019t the Eagles. They trusted a comedian\\u2026 [crowd cheers] \\u2026to make this happen. So I wanna say thank you. Is anybody else staying here at the, uh\\u2026 at the Hard Rock? [crowd cheers] Hey, me too.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a beautiful hotel, and I\\u2019m not just saying that \\u2019cause my room is free. [audience laughs] You know you\\u2019re in a nice hotel and casino when you turn on your TV in your room and they have their own video. Like, if you\\u2019re staying here, you turn on the TV, you get this, [trills tongue] [feminine voice] \\u201cWelcome to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [moans seductively] \\u201cTwenty-four-hour gambling, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\\u201d [moans suggestively] I\\u2019m sitting there like, \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t I stop watching this?\\u201d And I started thinking, at this point, why don\\u2019t they just do that to the slot machines? You know? Gambling\\u2019s already shameless. Might as well go all the way. You walk up to one of the little machines, pop in a 20. [whirring] [moans loudly] [whirring, moans] [feminine voice] \\u201cDon\\u2019t stop.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [audience laughs] People are walking by. \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cTrying to get the jackpot!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] Yeah, man. I\\u2019m gonna start the show off tonight with a question. That\\u2019s not how comedy shows happen, but I\\u2019m gonna start it with a question. The question is, who here tonight has never heard of me up until tonight? [scattered cheering] Five. Two. Five. Okay. To those of you, the five of you, I say, \\u201cSorry.\\u201d I know you got excited. You saw the ticket. You saw the last name, and then I walked out. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cEnrique got bigger.\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why I ask who has never seen or heard of me before is because if you have, then you know the type of show that I do. And you know the type of show that I don\\u2019t do. Like, I\\u2019m not here to tell you who to vote for, who not to vote for, what shot to take or what baby to get rid of. That\\u2019s not for me to say. If you\\u2019re already offended, you missed the point. I\\u2019m telling you what I\\u2019m not gonna do. I promise you, I am here to entertain, not offend. Okay? [audience cheers] We\\u2019re gonna have fun with everybody. Starting with me, but I\\u2019m gonna let you know, we\\u2019re living in a different time. I\\u2019ve been doing this so long, I always figured, as long as I\\u2019m being nice, I shouldn\\u2019t have any issues, but it\\u2019s a very different time. This is year 27 for me.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYeah. Twenty-seven years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I never had to worry. You know, when I first got started, shoot\\u2026 1997, I was clean-shaven, I had hair. I know. Look at some of you. \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d Huh? Vaccine. I know. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kid\\u2026 I\\u2019m kidding. Sorry, Florida. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kidding. I said \\u201cVaccine,\\u201d some of you were like, \\u201cI told you!\\u201d Yeah. [crowd laughs] [in Spanish] \\u201cI told you. He said so.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [in English] Some friends tell me, \\u201cDude, man, you\\u2019re making money now. Why don\\u2019t you get the hair thingy?\\u201d I said, \\u201cFor what?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, some women, they want a guy with hair.\\u201d Well, good for them.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd they\\u2019re not lying. I have gone out with some women that made it a point to tell me that hair was important. One told me flat out, \\u201cI need to be able to run my fingers through your hair.\\u201d Yeah! And I told her, \\u201cHey, look, if you go deep enough\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026you\\u2019re gonna get your wish.\\u201d \\u201cYou were not specific on location. Hey.\\u201d \\u201cYou want hair, you want pelos, I got you.\\u201d But, yeah, 27 years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I have seen a lot of comedians come and go. And I feel very grateful that in all that time, we\\u2019ve still managed to maintain a certain level.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo I feel like we\\u2019re doing something right. Which feels weird to me, because now I feel like you gotta be very mindful. Okay? You gotta be extra mindful. Like\\u2026 Uh, 27 years of being a comedian, I finally started hearing people tell me things that I\\u2019ve never heard before. I started hearing people tell me things like, \\u201cHey, Fluffy. I grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience chuckles] Which is an incredible compliment because that doesn\\u2019t just say that you\\u2019re a fan, that says that you\\u2019re invested. That says that you\\u2019ve been following this career for a very long time. Some of you, the first time you saw me perform, you were kids. [audience cheers] And now some of you are here tonight with your kids. [audience cheers] And so, I just want to say thank you for all those years of trust and continuing to come back to see the show. It means a lot. [audience cheers and applauds] Hearing someone say they grew up watching me, that is one of the most beautiful compliments any entertainer can receive. And I understand that now, with therapy, that that\\u2019s what that means.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nLook, I\\u2019m not gonna lie. The first time I heard someone tell me that they grew up watching me, I didn\\u2019t know how to handle it. I didn\\u2019t know how to process because nobody wants to feel like they\\u2019re getting\\u2026 old. The first time I heard it, I was like\\u2026 [gasps dramatically] Second time I heard it, I was like, \\u201cBuy a hat.\\u201d The third time, I accepted it. I was like, [as old white man\\u2019] \\u201cMany years ago, when I first got started, all of this was land as far as the eye could see.\\u201d \\u201cIt was a very different time, and\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I don\\u2019t know why my old voice is white. [audience laughs] He just is. I tried doing the Mexican voice, but you don\\u2019t take him as serious. [in Spanish] \\u201cWell, screw you.\\u201d \\u201cWe were at the ranch, and were told to fuck off, dude.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s very tough out there.\\u201d [in English] But times are changing. The rules are changing. So I don\\u2019t know how much longer this is gonna be okay. I\\u2019ll tell you what happened to me and why I brought that up. I did a podcast. And before I went into the studio, I\\u2019m talking to the producer outside. And the producer\\u2019s excited and happy, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGabriel Iglesias, we\\u2019re so excited to have you.\\u201d \\u201cThis is really cool.\\u201d \\u201cBefore you go in, the host wanted me to ask you something before you go in for your interview.\\u201d I go, \\u201cSure, go for it.\\u201d \\u201cOkay. What do you identify as?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I wasn\\u2019t sure how to answer that. I\\u2019m 47 years old. I didn\\u2019t know what to say. I was like, \\u201cShit. Hungry, I guess.\\u201d\\nI mean\\u2026\\n[audience laughs] I\\u2019m tired, sleepy, depressed on Tuesdays. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to say. See, here\\u2019s the thing. I knew what she was trying to ask me. I just wasn\\u2019t trying to get involved in a conversation about something that has absolutely nothing to do with me. This was\\u2026 Yeah. [audience cheers] I felt like I was being baited because no matter how I answered that question, I was gonna find myself in an awkward situation. So you know, because for me, I was just like, \\u201cLet me just be funny.\\u201d But nowadays, you can\\u2019t just not answer the question because silence is seen as a problem. And I\\u2019m sorry if me not answering a certain question is considered a problem. I was brought up during a time where you were constantly told to mind your business.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s all I\\u2019m trying to do is stay in my lane. Another thing we were constantly told was always respect your elders. [audience cheers] And no matter what generation you were from, that was at least the one thing we could always agree on until now. Now older people are seen as a problem. They are. You know, and I understand the youth of today has the technology in the palm of their hands, and you can google just about anything, but you cannot google life experience. Okay? You can\\u2019t. You can\\u2019t download struggling. You can\\u2019t download failure. You can\\u2019t download these moments that help build you up to make you a better person. And so again, for me, I chose to stay in my lane and just crack jokes when the girl asked me the question. She got very upset. She got very offended. As soon as I cracked the joke, she was like, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not what I mean.\\u201d \\u201cI mean what are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cFor example, are you a they or them?\\u201d \\u201cA they\\u201d? [audience chuckles] \\u201cOr a them\\u201d? [audience laughs] \\u201cHow fat am I?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhen did I stop being an it?\\u201d Apparently, I ate myself into a plural. That\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience chuckles and applauds]\\nWhat I\\u2019m finding is, even if you have good intentions, and you\\u2019re trying to be cool, you can still find yourself in a situation. So, I\\u2019ll tell you what else happened to me, m\\u2019kay? I was at a McDonald\\u2019s. [audience chuckles] That\\u2019s not even the joke, but okay. [audience laughs] All righty. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHere, this is gonna be good.\\u201d No, no! I was at a McDonald\\u2019s by my house. The McDonald\\u2019s by my house is actually a twofer. It\\u2019s a McDonald\\u2019s on the corner, and it\\u2019s also a gas station. I got a big SUV. I knew it was gonna be a minute. So I said, \\u201cLet me go get some nuggets while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I walk into the McDonald\\u2019s, and as I\\u2019m walking in, I couldn\\u2019t help but notice this homeless family sitting right outside. Now, they didn\\u2019t have a sign. They did not ask me for money, but you could just tell. You could just tell that this poor family is dealing with life. So I get inside, and I said, \\u201cYou know what?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t need anything to eat.\\u201d \\u201cI really don\\u2019t. At this point, it\\u2019s just the habit.\\u201d [audience laughs] I get to the register, and I say, \\u201cYou know what? Let me order some food for the family.\\u201d \\u201cThey got kids with them.\\u201d So I placed an order and the cashier\\u2019s like, \\u201cAnything else?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes. Do you have, um\\u2026 um, Wet-Naps?\\u201d \\u201cExcuse me?\\u201d \\u201cYou know, Wet-Naps to clean your hands.\\u201d \\u201cSir, you\\u2019re more than welcome to use the restroom.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll give you the code.\\u201d \\u201cHere\\u2019s the thing.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s not for me. It\\u2019s for the homeless family that\\u2019s right outside the door.\\u201d \\u201cI want to make sure that the little kids can clean their hands before they eat.\\u201d \\u201cThis food that I just ordered is for them.\\u201d And as we\\u2019re talking\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you. As we\\u2019re talking, the manager at the McDonald\\u2019s is listening in to our conversation. And she walks over. And she\\u2019s all nosy, right? She\\u2019s like, \\u201cExcuse me. I couldn\\u2019t help but overhear.\\u201d \\u201cDid you just say that this food is for the family outside?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I hope that\\u2019s okay.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, it is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cGiving food to people who need food is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cHowever, what you just called them is not okay.\\u201d [audience groans] [as self] \\u201cWhat did I call them?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cYou said\\u2026 homeless.\\u201d [as self] \\u201c\\u2018Cause they are! Look. Shit.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cHe\\u2019s lickin\\u2019 the window!\\u201d [audience laughs] [as manager] \\u201cYou can\\u2019t say that word. It\\u2019s considered offensive.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWho complained?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, well, if I\\u2019m not supposed to say the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019 anymore, what am I supposed to say instead of the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cThe new politically correct term is actually \\u2018unhoused\\u2019 when describing someone in an unfortunate situation like that.\\u201d [audience jeering] [as self] \\u201cYou\\u2019re kidding.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, sir. I\\u2019m not kidding. And please lower your voice.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYou want me to lower my voice when you\\u2019re saying something so ridiculous?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cIf you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly, you are part of the problem, not the solution.\\u201d [audience chuckling] Oh, Miami. I wanted to get ghetto. [audience cheers] I wanted to get ghetto. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I wanted to go full Hialeah on them. [audience cheering] [man] Love you, Fluffy! Thank you for coming, Hialeah. [audience cheers] So yeah, I wanted to go off on her, but I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I wanted to get ghetto, but I couldn\\u2019t because that is the regular McDonald\\u2019s I go to.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nYou know what I\\u2019m saying? I\\u2019m not trying to get banned. The next one\\u2019s far, and gas is a bitch, so I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNah.\\u201d So I looked at her, and I said, \\u201cOkay. We\\u2019re gonna play this game?\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s play this game.\\u201d \\u201cFrom now on, I\\u2019m no longer fat.\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201cAccording to you, I am now \\u2018unexercised.'\\u201d [audience laughs] [audience cheering] I did, bro. She looked at me, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t be ridiculous.\\u201d And I looked at her, and I was like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d \\u201cOh, well, if you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly you are part of the problem.\\u201d \\u201cNot the solution.\\u201d [audience cheers] And I grabbed the food, and I walked out. Now, second half of the story. I walk over to the family. M\\u2019kay? And I hand the bags of food to the mom. And the mom was so nice. She was just happy that someone thought of her and her kids. She got very emotional. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI just want to say thank you.\\u201d \\u201cYou have no idea what you\\u2019re doing for us right now.\\u201d \\u201cThis really means a lot.\\u201d \\u201cThank you.\\u201d And I had to ask the question. [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I know what you thought. Some of you are like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it.\\u201d Oh, I did it. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. Watch. So, I looked, and I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d And she was like, \\u201cNo, unfortunately. We\\u2019re not okay. We\\u2019re not.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been homeless now for four days.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you heard.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cBut, uh\\u2026\\u201d No, not\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience chuckles] I didn\\u2019t correct her \\u2019cause I\\u2019m not a dick. That\\u2019s why I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience laughs] That\\u2019s what I mean, you guys. Even if you have good intentions nowadays, people can take what you\\u2019re saying or doing and twist it to make you look bad. There should be no consequences for being kind, for trying to help, for wanting to do the right thing, for caring. Unfortunately, we\\u2019re still consumed by this word called \\u201cliability\\u201d that sometimes we forget to be a little human, and that\\u2019s unfortunate. I\\u2019m not trying to get on a soapbox about this. I\\u2019m trying to let you know some things I\\u2019ve been dealing with, and I\\u2019m just here to report. [audience chuckles] The thing with me now is that after 27 years of being a comedian, every time I walk out the door, the light is officially on. In the sense that every time I leave my house, there is a slight chance I could make the news. For example, did Martin talk about how, uh, he fell off the stage earlier in the show?\\n[crowd] Yeah.\\nOkay. Okay, cool. Uh, for the home audience, Martin, he fell a while back. He talked about it. I know you didn\\u2019t see it, \\u2019cause your subscription only covers so much.\\nUm, yeah.\\n[audience laughs] You can watch the first half on Prime. I think it\\u2019s on Prime. Maybe you can just see it there then come back and check out the rest. So, long story short, we were doing a show in Phoenix, Arizona, and Martin accidentally fell off of a stage this high, and he broke his foot. Now, the incredible part about Martin is that he got up, and on adrenaline, ran around, got back up on stage, and performed. And then was taken to the hospital after he walked off stage. He is a professional. [audience cheers] Seriously, that is a pro. Much respect \\u2019cause if it would have been me\\u2026 [audience chuckles] If I would\\u2019ve fallen off stage, and the staff was like, \\u201cWhat about the fans?\\u201d \\u201cWell, bye, Felicia.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhat do we tell \\u2019em?\\u201d \\u201cRefund.\\u201d [audience laughs] But see, the difference is Martin had to tell you he fell for you to know he fell. And by the way, I saw the fall. I saw. He came out and just kind of tripped over a cord backstage, came through the curtain already, you know. And then, you know\\u2026 \\u201cMartiiin!\\u201d [imitates thud] Women in the front row were like, \\u201cHe fell for me.\\u201d [audience laughs] I\\u2019m glad you laughed. I said that last night and some guy was like, \\u201cAw.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cWhy \\u2018aww\\u2019?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s your friend.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cExactly. That\\u2019s why I make fun of him.\\u201d That is the mark of a true friendship, is being able to say real evil things about each other. [audience cheers] Because you know you don\\u2019t really mean it. Plus, you don\\u2019t think that if I would\\u2019ve fallen off the stage instead of Martin that he wouldn\\u2019t\\u2019ve had a joke? You better believe he would have had a joke. He would have told people, \\u201cI saw Fluffy bounce.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot to mention the fact that you know that\\u2019ll make the news. I fall off the stage tonight, there\\u2019ll be a van out in front in an hour. \\u201cWe\\u2019re standing here live in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, where authorities believe Fluffy lost control.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to Tom, who\\u2019s inside the venue who can fill us in with more.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, Jim, I\\u2019m standing here at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, inside the venue where apparently Fluffy took a spill.\\u201d \\u201cIt is still uncertain as to what happened here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cWe did have a chance to interview local authorities who had this to say.\\u201d \\u201cDamn!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt is still uncertain if there was any problems with the stage.\\u201d \\u201cWe did speak to security who had this to comment.\\u201d \\u201cI saw the whole damn thing. Okay?\\u201d \\u201cWhoo! Fluffy fell. He fell hard.\\u201d \\u201cI ain\\u2019t seen that many white people cry since a Taylor Swift concert.\\u201d \\u201cIt was bad. It was bad. And in Miami. Are you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cHe hurt more Cubans than Castro.\\u201d [audience laughs] And that\\u2019s how you get canceled. So, uh, that\\u2019s the point I\\u2019m trying to make here. I made the news recently. Uh, without giving too much away, there\\u2019s an episode of Family Feud coming out very soon that I\\u2019m gonna be on. Yeah.\\n[audience applauds]\\nIt is the celebrity edition, so it\\u2019s Fluffy and Fluffy\\u2019s family versus Fat Joe\\u2026 [audience gasps] \\u2026and his family. So yeah, it\\u2019s Fat Joe versus Fluffy because apparently, the producers have a great sense of humor. [audience laughs] Long story short, I flew in some family from the East Coast to be on the show. The show went over very well. You\\u2019ll find out who wins later. Here\\u2019s the deal. The next day, my sister, who was one of the people I flew in, she hadn\\u2019t been in California in forever, and she was like, \\u201cCan we go to Disneyland?\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cSure, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d So it was her and her husband Gordy, and I took them to Disney. And we get on a couple of rides, and just so we\\u2019re clear, that\\u2019s not what made the news. [audience chuckles] I said that last night, someone was like, \\u201c\\u2018Cause he fit.\\u201d No!\\n[audience laughs]\\nSome people. Right? Yeah. We get on the Cars ride at California Adventure, and halfway through the Cars ride, the car\\u2026 [imitates engine revving, brakes screeching] \\u2026stops on the track. And my sister looked at me. She goes, \\u201cIs this supposed to happen?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, the check cleared. We\\u2019re supposed to finish. This is, uh\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWe paid. It\\u2019s supposed to work. No, this\\u2026\\u201d It took the Disney people about 20 minutes to come get us and take us out of the car. So we\\u2019re sitting there, outside, in the sun for 20 minutes. I had no problem with that because I am mocha. I\\u2019m okay in the sun for 20 minutes. My sister, she\\u2019s twice as dark as me. She\\u2019s, like, freaking, you know, Apache. She\\u2019s\\u2026 You know. Freaking Azteca. [chanting] Just, you know\\u2026 Her husband, on the other hand, he\\u2019s from Minnesota. [audience laughs] He almost died.\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cOh, don\\u2019 cha know?\\u201d Yeah, so\\u2026 while we\\u2019re sitting there in the car, waiting for the Disney people to come take us out of the car, the people waiting in line realize that the ride has been shut down. And so from the ride, you can see the line. People see the car on the track, and then they see who\\u2019s in the car. [audience chuckles] And all of a sudden, cell phones start comin\\u2019 out. And by the time we left Disney, TMZ had already reported the story, and you can google this, okay? TMZ reported the story. Before we left the park, it said, \\u201cFluffy Stuck on LA Freeway at Disney.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I thought it was cute. I thought it was silly. I thought it was funny. I thought it was okay. Until I read the comments. [audience chuckles] Oh, some of you\\u2026 are dicks. [audience laughs] One lady wrote, \\u201cJust \\u2019cause you\\u2019re tall enough to ride doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re small enough to fit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nA guy wrote, \\u201cThe car got tired.\\u201d [audience laughs] Another guy wrote, \\u201cYou\\u2019re Mexican. Couldn\\u2019t you fix it?\\u201d [audience laughs] And that was Martin, yeah. So\\u2026 [audience laughs] [imitates rim shot] Anyway, so\\u2026 The time before that, we made world news. Some of you might remember this story. The guys and I were involved in an emergency landing situation. I had, uh, chartered a private jet because my last Netflix special, the money finally hit my account, and I, you know, freakin\\u2019\\u2026 I thought I was, y\\u2019know, ballin\\u2019, right? Nope. Turns out we were fallin\\u2019! Worst turbulence we have ever experienced in 27 years of being comedians. Uh, worst turbulence I ever felt, for sure. At one point, the jet did this.\\n[whooshes]\\n[audience chuckles] I did this.\\n[imitates thud]\\n[audience chuckles] The scariest part was watching my dogs leave the seat. Fortunately, we landed safely. We were okay. That\\u2019s not what made the news. What made the news is that, when we came in for the landing, the jet touched down, and then it skid off the runway by 200 yards, and we ended up in a field. A field. A field! Are you kidding me? As hard as I work\\u2026 [audience laughs] [audience applauds] \\u2026to break stereotypes. [audience laughs] A bunch of Mexicans ended up in a field. Yeah, that\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat\\u2019s how TMZ reported it. \\u201cMexicans Found in Field.\\u201d [audience chuckles] In the movies, the pilots are always the first to know when there\\u2019s an issue. And in the movies, the pilots always have the courtesy of telling the passengers. They love to hear themselves talk. They get on the mic, \\u201cAll right. It\\u2019s your captain speaking here.\\u201d \\u201cI just want to let you know we\\u2019ll be experiencing rough air.\\u201d \\u201cIf you could just fasten your seatbelts, we\\u2019re gonna be A-okay. All right\\u2026\\u201d [murmurs] You know? If it gets bumpy, you know, [whooshing] [as captain, mumbling] \\u201cIt\\u2019s your captain speaking.\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just had a little Mexican food here, so we\\u2026 we\\u2019re feeling a little bumpy up here.\\u201d \\u201cWe just had some fast food.\\u201d \\u201cJust a reminder to keep your seat belts fastened.\\u201d \\u201cWe might be getting a bit\\u2026 There we go. Just a bit there.\\u201d [laughs] \\u201cAll right, I\\u2019ll be back with you in just a few seconds\\u2026\\u201d [mumbles indistinctly] If the plane\\u2019s going down, \\u201cBrace for impact!\\u201d \\u201cHold on tight! We\\u2019re comin\\u2019 in hot!\\u201d Our pilot\\u2026 nada.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOur pilot didn\\u2019t say anything until we came to, like, a complete stop. And then maybe like a minute later, the cockpit door opened up, and he stuck his head in, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou good?\\u201d [audience laughs] I was like, \\u201cMy chihuahua\\u2019s in a cup holder. I am not good.\\u201d It was a scary situation, you guys, but let me tell you, even though we were involved in an emergency landing and we thought we were gonna die, I\\u2019m grateful for the experience. Believe it or not. I\\u2019m grateful because it reminded me how valuable life is and how quickly things can change.\\n[audience applauds]\\nEvery now and then, we need a little reminder. We need to get shaken up a little to remind ourselves, \\u201cOh my God. This is special.\\u201d \\u201cThis is important. Enjoy it. Have fun.\\u201d The rest of the day after the landing, there was nothing anybody could tell me to ruin how good I felt to just be breathing and be alive. Nothing! [audience cheers and applauds] And so, that\\u2019s why I, uh\\u2026 I\\u2019m grateful for bad moments. And I think bad moments are actually a good thing because we need balance in life. You need to have bad experiences in order to truly appreciate good experiences. Not every day can be the same. [audience applauds] You need to have a way to ba\\u2013 Now, don\\u2019t get me wrong. Sometimes there\\u2019s too many bad days in a row. That shit sucks. And that\\u2019s actually what happened to me. After the near-death experience, I go home. I go home to find out that someone broke into my house. [audience gasps] Yeah. Yeah, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I survived? To see this shit?\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why you haven\\u2019t heard about it until now is because the detective who\\u2019s working the case told me I\\u2019m not allowed to talk about it. In California.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah, if the guys that broke into my house are here tonight\\u2026 [scoffs] \\u2026bravo. [sarcastically] Bravo. That\\u2019s a flex and a half. No, they broke into my house, and of course, the number one question is, \\u201cWhat did they take from your house?\\u201d And what they took from me, honestly, it was my peace of mind. I didn\\u2019t feel safe in that house after. Uh, but if you must know, I did everything to prevent a break-in. I had, first of all, a good neighborhood. I had an alarm. I had two camera systems. I had a fence that surrounded the property. I thought I was good. Um, I got video footage of the entire robbery.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIn 4K. [audience chuckles] Oh, that shit is crisp. I saw the guys that broke in, but I could not identify them because they were wearing masks. All I can tell you about the two guys that broke into my house is that they were 20 years old. I know they were 20 because when they jumped the fence and hit the ground, no pain.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf that would\\u2019ve been a 35-year-old with messed-up sciatica, he\\u2019d have thought twice about that fence. So, they jumped the fence, went in the backyard, and they broke the window and got in through the kitchen. They trashed my house. Okay, every drawer, open. Every cabinet, open. Everything got pulled out onto the floor so they could sift. Uh\\u2026 Couches were flipped over, cushions were thrown down, and they pulled every single frame off the wall. And I asked the detective, I said, \\u201cHey, look. I understand the drawers, the cabinets, and even the couch thing.\\u201d \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the story with the frames on the wall?\\u201d \\u201cWhy did they take everything off the wall but didn\\u2019t take any frames?\\u201d \\u201cSome of that stuff was art.\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cMr. Iglesias, you have to understand something about these people that broke into your home.\\u201d \\u201cThey were not looking for photos or art.\\u201d \\u201cThey were actually looking for a safe.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cYes, sir. A safe.\\u201d \\u201cA lot of times, in these homes, people will put a hole in the wall, install a safe, and then they\\u2019ll hang a frame over the safe to disguise that their valuables are in there.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d\\n[audience chuckles]\\n[as cop] \\u201cSir, yes, a safe.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cBut I just got this money.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cDid they check the mattress?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as cop] \\u201cDon\\u2019t know.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s find out!\\u201d So, we walk into the master bedroom. I grab the edge of the bed, right? And I picked it up, and I was like, \\u201cAh, stupid!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all here.\\u201d Oh my God. These guys had no idea they were robbing somebody more ghetto than them. [audience laughs] So, at the end of it, they only got a couple of little trinkets from the drawers. Um, and that\\u2019s pretty much it. They made a mess of the house. They didn\\u2019t get any of the money. I\\u2019ll tell you what they did get. They got my guns. [audience exclaims] Now\\u2026 I have never been open about the fact that I am, in fact, a registered gun owner.\\n[audience cheers]\\nRelax, Florida. [audience laughs] I\\u2019ve never been open about it because, quite frankly, it\\u2019s nobody\\u2019s business. Okay? However, it does pertain to the story that I\\u2019m about to share with you. Um, I am a recent gun owner. I became a gun owner in 2020, m\\u2019kay? Uh, yeah, when we were in the middle of\\u2026 [loudly] \\u2026it. [audience laughs] Every morning watching the news, we didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen, and it started to feel irresponsible, not preparing myself for a worst-case situation. Every morning watching the news, it felt like we were headed towards the Purge. [audience chuckles] Some of you are laughing, but think about this, the Purge would have taken less time. [audience chuckles] Yeah, the Purge. That\\u2019s how they should\\u2019ve woke us up, at least for entertainment purposes. [imitates alarm sounding] [feminine voice] \\u201cI\\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in the pandemic.\\u201d \\u201cThe local time is 7:45 a.m.\\u201d [moans seductively]\\n[audience laughs]\\nFear is why I decided to buy a gun. I was afraid, and I got no problem saying that. I was scared. We didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen. Um, it\\u2019s only for protection. I don\\u2019t hunt. I don\\u2019t want to hunt. I don\\u2019t need to. I know where there\\u2019s three Chick-fil-As. [audience laughs] I\\u2019m good. I don\\u2019t go out on the weekends, you know? Pull! [imitates rifle firing] There\\u2019s no\\u2026 [quacking] I still own a Nintendo. I don\\u2019t need that shit. Fear is the only reason why I decided to buy a gun. So, I wound up at this sporting goods store right by my house. I walk in there, and this place is packed full of people that normally would not have been open to the idea of owning a gun, but they felt like me. They were scared, and rightfully so. I kept hearing the same conversation over and over and over. I kept hearing this\\u2026 \\u201cI would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it.\\u201d [audience cheers] [audience applauds] And I don\\u2019t care where you\\u2019re from, that makes a lot of sense. And I was not about to let politics interfere with my personal safety. So, next thing you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] So, next thing you know, I got in line. I had to get a ticket with a number like when you\\u2019re at the DMV or meat market. [in Spanish] The butcher shop. The bodega. \\u201cNumber five!\\u201d [in English] I got in line. Forty-five minutes, I waited in line. And as soon as I get to the front, this guy comes to the counter, and he\\u2019s like\\u2026 [in Southern accent] \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, um\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I heard some of you chuckle, and just so we\\u2019re clear, I\\u2019m not saying that\\u2026 all people [sighs] \\u2026who sell guns\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u2026talk like that. [audience laughs] But his name was Jim. [audience laughs] So, Jim was like, \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m here to see about purchasing my first firearm.\\u201d \\u201cWell, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Know what you want?\\u201d \\u201cOr you need a hand?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019ve had some time to look at your selection, and I think I found something that\\u2019s gonna work for me.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. Show me what you got.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, right over here in the case.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, right here.\\u201d \\u201cThis one. The one right here, in the front.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. Not that one. This one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. This one. Not that one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. The one in front.\\u201d \\u201cWith the tag. The tag. Right here. The one that says two-two.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cUm, sir, did you just call that gun\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cYeah. What?\\u201d \\u201cJi\\u2026 Jim, right? Jim? Jim.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at me like I\\u2019m crazy, dude. I\\u2019m just reading the tag.\\u201d \\u201cIt says it right here. In the front. It says two-two.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou mean a .22?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, yeah. I guess. Two-two, .22, same thing.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, I hate to break it to you, but there\\u2019s a big difference between a tutu and a .22.\\u201d \\u201cBut hey, this is California, so whatever floats your boat, son.\\u201d \\u201cAll right?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cNow, is there any particular reason why you have selected a, uh\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cWell, um, as impressive as your selection of guns here is, I recognize a lot of them from movies.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s a bit much for me.\\u201d \\u201cUm, I\\u2019m very simple.\\u201d \\u201cUm, this gun looks very manageable.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s small and, you know, it looks easy.\\u201d \\u201cPlus, it\\u2019s on sale.\\u201d \\u201cYou know what I mean? Come on, man.

She\\u2019ll never find me here.\\u201d \\u201cSo, this bullet, when it comes out the chamber, it opens up.\\u201d \\u201cAnd when it hits, it\\u2019ll leave a hole about yay big.\\u201d And stupid me, I said this, I said, \\u201cPeople survive that?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as Jim] \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSon, you don\\u2019t want \\u2019em to survive.\\u201d \\u201cYou want \\u2019em dead as fried chicken, as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\u201d [audience applauds] I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anybody to die.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want anybody to die?!\\u201d \\u201cYou guys hear that?\\u201d \\u201cYou hear that?

I felt that. I felt it.\\u201d Um\\u2026 \\u201cIf I\\u2019m cornered like that, and I have absolutely no choice, and my life is in danger, I promise you, Jim, I will step up, man, and I will shoot them right in the leg.\\u201d \\u201cI will.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cYou think you\\u2019re gonna hit the leg, Mr. First-Time Gun Owner?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHey, if I buy that bullet you\\u2019re trying to sell me, that covers that much, up close, I can hit a leg.\\u201d \\u201cTwo steps closer, I\\u2019ll shoot him in the huevos. I will, dude.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll hit a pelota. I will. No more babies, man.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. All right. You don\\u2019t gotta get graphic on me, now.\\u201d \\u201cSon, you know what\\u2019s gonna happen if you shoot someone in your home, in the leg, and they live?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I know.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sleep better, knowing I didn\\u2019t take a life and I was able to protect my home, my family, and my stuff.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen.\\u201d [as Jim] Ah. \\u201cClearly, you\\u2019re a Disney fan.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cThat\\u2019s about the biggest fantasy I\\u2019ve ever heard, right there.\\u201d \\u201cSon, I would ask you if you knew, but clearly, you don\\u2019t, so I\\u2019m not gonna waste my time spinnin\\u2019 my wheels on this one.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna call it like it is.\\u201d \\u201cIf you shoot someone in your home and they live, they can come back and sue your ass.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. Now, here\\u2019s the kicker.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. They\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cAnd not only are they gonna get everything they wanted to get when they first broke in, when it\\u2019s all said and done, you are gonna cut them a big fat check.\\u201d \\u201cNow, what do you got to say about that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat motherfucker\\u2019s gonna die!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nHe got excited. [as Jim] \\u201cNow, we\\u2019re talkin\\u2019!\\u201d I found out something that day. I found out that people that sell guns are a lot like people that sell used cars. They play on your emotions, and then they start to upsell you and make you buy things you don\\u2019t want or need. He knew I was scared because he kept saying it to me. [as Jim] \\u201cI know you\\u2019re scared.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re scared, and your fears. You\\u2019re worried. You\\u2019re scared.\\u201d Every time he\\u2019d say \\u201cscared,\\u201d something else appeared on the counter. [audience laughs] He sold me so well that when he was done \\u201cselling me,\\u201d I wound up with four rifles\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026and four handguns and a case\\u2026 a case of spreader ammunition. [audience chuckles] I hear some of you clapping, and why? It\\u2019s excessive. I only have two hands. [audience laughs] See, I feel, again, even though my home was burglarized, I feel grateful because I wasn\\u2019t there and I had my dogs with me. I can\\u2019t replace my dogs. I can\\u2019t replace me. [audience cheering] Stuff is stuff. However, if I would have been home, I would have done whatever I needed to do. That\\u2019s the difference. In this situation, there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me, had the guns, had the ammo, glad they weren\\u2019t there, but if they were there, they would\\u2019ve done something about it. \\u2018Cause if I was in bed and I heard the\\u2026 [imitates crashing] \\u2026I would\\u2019ve jumped up. [grunting] I would\\u2019ve grabbed my gun. [imitates gun cocking] I would\\u2019ve ran out into the living room with no shirt on and one sock off.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI\\u2019d have confronted the person. \\u201cFreeze!\\u201d Knowing my luck\\u2026 [audience chuckles] [as burglar] \\u201cFluffy?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI said, freeze!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re funny. You\\u2019re funny, bro.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re funny.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cGet on the ground!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh!\\u201d [as self] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make me shoot you.\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cAh, hey!\\u201d [exclaims] \\u201cHey, Beto, get in here! Get in here! You\\u2019ll never guess whose house this is!\\u201d The other guy runs in. [as Beto] \\u201cOh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey.\\u201d \\u201cI grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience laughs and cheers] Next thing you know, I\\u2019m autographing things they\\u2019re about to take. [audience chuckles] [mouthing inaudibly] [audience laughs] [continues mouthing] [audience laughs] So like I said, in this situation, I feel like there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me. Had the guns, had the ammunition. Glad they weren\\u2019t home, but if they would have been home, they would have done something about it. That\\u2019s one type of people. The other kind of people are the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to\\u2026\\n[scattered cheering]\\nOh. Good. You\\u2019re here. [audience laughs] The kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to confront an intruder because you know you have way more guns and ammunition than they do, and you are prepared for war. [audience cheers] The kind of people who sit home at night in the living room, in the dark, holding their gun.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[imitates rifle cocking] They leave the front door unlocked to make it easier. [audience laughs] And people like that always have a friend either across the street or across town. \\u201cHow is everything over there on your side?\\u201d [imitating radio static] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all clear over here. How about you?\\u201d \\u201cYeah. Coast is clear. Ten-four. Out.\\u201d There. This situation, the break-in, left me traumatized. I couldn\\u2019t go back to living in the house because I didn\\u2019t feel safe. It\\u2019s just me and two chihuahuas. Yeah, that\\u2019s it. I\\u2019m no longer with my son\\u2019s mom, and my son lives with his mom. So, you know\\u2026 And by the way, I told my son Frankie what happened, about the break-in, and right away, right away, \\u201cOh, really? They\\u2019re lucky I wasn\\u2019t there.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cC\\u00e1lmate, John Wick.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThey would\\u2019ve kidnapped you.\\u201d \\u201cI would\\u2019ve had to pay double to get you back.\\u201d I could not go back to living at the house. Again, it\\u2019s just me. So, I put the house up for sale. Uh, yeah, I just couldn\\u2019t. And it was a big beautiful home that you guys helped pay for. Thank you. [audience chuckles] It was nice. Real nice. Freaking four bathrooms. Four bathrooms. Yeah. One penis.\\n[audience laughs]\\nEven if I ran, I couldn\\u2019t, you know\\u2026 I put the house up for sale, and here\\u2019s the dilemma that I faced. I put it up for sale before I had a new place to live because I figured I\\u2019m on the road, I\\u2019m always in a tour bus, a plane, a hotel, always somewhere. I\\u2019m on the go. I was just trying to get ahead of it because when I first bought the house, it was sitting on the market for almost two years. So I thought I had time. What happened was it sold like that because I had two people bidding on the house at the same time and they kept driving up the price. And one of the people trying to buy the house, he wanted all of my furniture and so my agent for the house goes, \\u201cGabriel, this is crazy.\\u201d \\u201cThese two guys are bidding on your house, and they want to give you way more than what you\\u2019re asking.\\u201d \\u201cOne of them wants to give you an extra $100,000 for all of your furniture.\\u201d \\u201cI suggest you take it.\\u201d And so, I did. I sold the house with everything, except the mattress. Everything. The problem is I don\\u2019t have a house right now. I don\\u2019t have anywhere to live, so technically, I\\u2019m, um\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\nFuck it. I\\u2019m homeless. I don\\u2019t care. [audience cheers] I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019m not gonna be \\u201cunhoused.\\u201d I\\u2019m homeless right now. They can\\u2019t cancel me. What are they gonna do? Take my house? I don\\u2019t have one. Ha! [audience laughs] So whatever. Mm. But no, at this point, at\\u2026 at 47 years of age, I don\\u2019t need more stuff. I\\u2019m happy that I do have stuff, but I don\\u2019t need it. What I want more than anything else now is better relationships. Better friendships, better people in my life, that\\u2019s what I want more than anything else. I announced in my last special at Dodger Stadium that I was no longer in a relationship. And I thought that was the best place to announce that because I\\u2019ve been very open about my life, my whole show is my life. People kept asking about her. So I thought that was the best place to announce that. You know what happens when you tell 50,000 people at a stadium that you\\u2019re single and then Netflix airs that around the world? I received thousands of \\u201capplications\\u201d for the Fluffy fulfillment center. Yes, I did. [chime dings] [Gabriel] That\\u2019s right, Netflix. Fluffy is hoein\\u2019 out. [audience chuckles] It was incredible. It was exciting. It was overwhelming, And it was terrifying because I didn\\u2019t know what they wanted. Um, well, I\\u2019m gonna tell you that since announcing that I was single, I\\u2019ve gone out on a few dates. And, uh, yeah. I don\\u2019t want to say how many, \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t want your judgment. [chuckles] \\u201cFluffy\\u2019s a whore.\\u201d [in English and Spanish] \\u201cHe\\u2019s nasty.\\u201d [in English] \\u201cHe\\u2019s like Santa with all his ho ho hos, yeah.\\u201d I still want to go out. I still want to have fun, I want to make connections, but unfortunately, I don\\u2019t trust people. I\\u2019m afraid. I can meet people really easy, but then I find out what they\\u2019re up to, and that sucks. Um, my heart is guarded now. Super guarded. There\\u2019s a wall and then a wall and then a wall and a wall and a wall. I\\u2019m like the only Mexican who likes walls.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo moving forward, I can tell you I don\\u2019t want to be in another relationship. I\\u2019m actually doing okay. I still want to go out, but I don\\u2019t want to be in a committed relationship. I\\u2026 I don\\u2019t. No.\\n[man boos]\\n[grunts] What do you mean, \\u201cBoo\\u201d? The fact that I\\u2019m being honest about that I don\\u2019t want to be in a relationship, I think there\\u2019s something to be said about that. I could easily lie. Meet someone, say that we\\u2019re boyfriend/girlfriend, and have a thing. But does it mean anything if your behavior doesn\\u2019t change? I\\u2019m being up front and honest. All I want\\u2026 All I want\\u2026 All I want, watch\\u2026 To the guy that booed me for saying I don\\u2019t want a relationship. Raise your hand so I can\\u2026 Okay, you\\u2019re famous, so\\u2026\\nTo you\\u2026 What is your name?\\n[man] Justin.\\nJustin?\\nDustin. Dustin. All right, Dustin. Sorry for\\u2026 \\u201cDustin!\\u201d Like, all right, \\u201cChill, bitch.\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, right? Freakin\\u2019 \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [Gabriel and audience laugh] All right, Dustin. Me not wanting to be in a traditional relationship is a honest thing because, uh, I can tell you, I don\\u2019t want to be in a situation where I\\u2019m obligated to participate in things that don\\u2019t make me feel like a good person. And at the age of 47, I\\u2019m tired of arguing, yelling, feeling guilted, feeling obligated, not smiling more. [audience cheers] I\\u2019m good, man. I\\u2026 You know\\u2026 But I still want to go out. So I just want to be up front and honest. All I need, Dustin, watch, is someone to eat with. [audience cheers] Someone to drink with. Someone to go to movies with. And someone to cuddle with. [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And they don\\u2019t even gotta be the same person.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll I\\u2019m saying is sometimes it takes a village. Okay? Dustin, I would love to tell a woman, \\u201cHey, would you like to go see a movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cYeah.\\u201d Then we go. After the movie\\u2019s over, I go, \\u201cWhat did you think?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cRight?\\u201d \\u201cWould you like to see another movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cSure. When?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNext week?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s stay in touch. See you next week.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna be so cool. You like rom-coms. I like rom-coms.\\u201d \\u201cYou like horror movies. I like horror.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna work. I like this. I need this. [grunts] Can\\u2019t wait.\\u201d So I say, \\u201cAll right, gotta go.\\u201d And she gets weird. [as woman] \\u201cWait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.\\u201d \\u201cYou gotta go? I thought this was going good.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s going great. We\\u2019ll do more next week. This is cool.\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the rush?\\u201d \\u201cWhere are you headed? Where you going?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cUh, I\\u2019m about to call the cuddler. Why?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as woman] \\u201cThe cuddler, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI got that covered.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, movies, that\\u2019s your lane. Stay in it, okay?\\u201d \\u201cThis is us. We\\u2019re good. Solid. You\\u2019re the movie girl, okay?\\u201d Now, Dustin. I didn\\u2019t tell her. But I\\u2019m gonna tell you. When it comes to the department of cuddling, and this is so crazy because I\\u2019ve always been in a relationship and I could never be this open and honest, but now that I\\u2019m single, these are Fluffy\\u2019s flavors. [audience laughs] So, when it comes to the department of cuddling, this is what I want. I want a woman. A woman. A woman. With original factory settings. [audience laughs and cheers] [speaks indistinctly] This woman needs to be equal to, or greater than, in size. She needs to be a big girl. I prefer a big girl.\\nI want a big girl.\\n[audience cheers] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. This way, we both can agree on the temperature of the thermostat. [audience laughs and applauds] And only big girls know what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. [audience laughs] See, I\\u2019m a big boy, and as a big boy, I always run hot. Heat affects my mood. When I\\u2019m hot, Dustin, I become irritable, cranky, my anxiety goes through the roof. So for me to feel comfortable, I like to set the room to 68 degrees. Okay? [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And only a big girl can truly appreciate that. Skinny women, not so much. And let me tell you, I am tired of disappointing, skinny, cold women. [audience laughs] Skinny, cold women are mean. They\\u2019re mean. They don\\u2019t want it at freakin\\u2019 68 degrees. No, they want 72, 73, 74. [in Spanish] You\\u2019re killing me. No! [in English] But I can\\u2019t do that to them. I can\\u2019t put them in 68 degrees. They get snippy. They get evil. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh my God. What\\u2019s your problem?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cWell, fuckin\\u2019 eat something.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] \\u201cI\\u2019m tired of sweating.\\u201d But, yeah. Anyway, Dustin, I apologize. I wasn\\u2019t trying to turn this into a TED Talk. [audience chuckles] I don\\u2019t want you to think that I don\\u2019t believe in love because I do, and anyone who can pull it off, I commend you for it. I have met so many couples over the years. I\\u2019ve met 20-year couples, 30-year couples, 40-year couples, 50-year couples. I met one 55.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. Yeah. I call them unicorns. I\\u2019ll tell you the story. I was in Savannah, Georgia. And I had just finished filming the second Magic Mike movie. Now\\u2026 Yeah, I know. For those of you that don\\u2019t know, I was in Magic Mike. [audience cheers] Yes. I know. I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. [audience laughs] Magic Mike, not Tragic Mike. So, let\\u2019s remember that, okay? I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. So, um\\u2026 Here\\u2019s the thing, after the movie, after we wrapped, my manager, Joe, tells me, he says, \\u201cDude, man.\\u201d \\u201cCongratulations on another project.\\u201d \\u201cI want to take you out for a steak dinner.\\u201d I said, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d So he takes me to this restaurant called Ruth\\u2019s Chris Steak House. Now, very popular chain around the country. We go there, we sit down, and here comes the server and the server\\u2019s real bubbly. \\u201cHey, guys. What\\u2019s going on? Are we celebrating anything today?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes, we are.\\u201d \\u201cWell, guess what? You\\u2019re not the only ones.\\u201d \\u201cYou see that couple over there?\\u201d \\u201cThat couple is celebrating 55 years of marriage today.\\u201d And we\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d So, we look. [whoosh]\\n[audience chuckles]\\nI said, \\u201cHow come they\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as server] \\u201cI wondered the same thing, but the man made it a point to say 55 years.\\u201d \\u201cI thought that was pretty impressive.\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, it is.\\u201d So he leaves to go get us some sodas and some bread. And I tell my manager, I said, \\u201cHey, Joe, listen.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019mma go say hi to the couple real quick.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t get us kicked out.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make it like last time.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s not gonna be.\\u201d So I get up, and I push in my chair, and I make my way over to the couple. Now, I understand how important this night is for them. I know exactly how long it took to get to that point, and I am not trying to mess that up. But I have questions. [audience chuckles] And these two people are clearly professionals in that department. So I approached the table as tactfully as I could. And I said, \\u201cPardon the interruption.\\u201d \\u201cIt has come to my attention that we are celebrating 55 years of marriage.\\u201d And the man was so happy that someone acknowledged that. He was just thrilled. He\\u2019s like\\u2026 [breathing excitedly] [as older man] \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, son.\\u201d \\u201cFifty-five years ago today, this lovely lady sittin\\u2019 next to me right here said I do, and we\\u2019ve been together ever since.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cThat is beautiful.\\u201d \\u201cMay I ask you a question?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cAbsolutely.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHow come you\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience chuckles] [laughs as older man] \\u201cHe wants to know how come we\\u2019re\\u2026 Laugh, goddammit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cSon, when you\\u2019ve been together as long as the two of us have, you might\\u2019ve seen a thing or two.\\u201d Uh, uh\\u2026 \\u201cWe have children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.\\u201d \\u201cWe have traveled this great big world of ours many times over.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re both retired military.\\u201d \\u201cWe have seen the best in people.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, unfortunately, when you\\u2019re around and alive as long as the two of us have been, uh, you\\u2019ve unfortunately seen the worst in people as well.\\u201d \\u201cWe have had just about every type of conversation there is to have. [audience chuckles] At least twice. [audience laughs] And after 55 years of marriage, well, hell, we\\u2019re just trying to enjoy each other\\u2019s company, even if it\\u2019s in silence.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve had every type of conversation there is to have?\\u201d And I guess I triggered him, because he was like, \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been in combat.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can faze me.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can surprise me anymore.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t say.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] So, I took a step towards them, I grab my shirt, and I flash them. [audience laughs] And then I walked away. And you know what happened next? They started talking! [audience laughs and cheers] I gave that couple the greatest gift they will never ever acknowledge. Something new, something spontaneous, something outrageous, something neither one of them had ever seen before. I gave them a new story. I promise you, every year moving forward, all they\\u2019re gonna talk about is what happened at 55. [as older man] \\u201cRemember, honey. Remember when that Samoan flashed us?\\u201d [audience laughs] Right. \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m a giver. I remember many, many years ago, before there was a venue like this to perform in, the only place around here for comedians to do shows was at a comedy club right outside these doors that was part of the original layout of the casino. [audience cheers] It was a club called The Improv. There\\u2019s a chain all over. [audience cheers] And, you know, many, many years ago, before all of this, that\\u2019s where Martin and myself, my buddy Alfred, we\\u2019d go do shows at the\\u2026 at the club. And the first time we got a chance to perform there, I didn\\u2019t really have a name. I wasn\\u2019t really established yet. And I want to take this moment to acknowledge and thank one person who was super, super helpful in that, a man by the name of DJ Laz.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s right, people. The Pimp with the Limp. Oh, yeah, Pap\\u00e1. Yeah. \\u201cIt\\u2019s your boy, DJ Laz.\\u201d I love him, man. He\\u2019s great. He\\u2019s awesome. But yeah, he walks in circles. He does. He walks in circles. Nice guy. DJ Laz was one of the first people to allow me to be on morning radio with him, and he helped promote my shows. Not only would he allow me to go on his show and promote my shows, he would come to my shows, and he would bring people, and he\\u2019d watch and he\\u2019d sit and hang out and laugh. The man has a million things he can do in Miami, but he\\u2019d come watch my show. And then the next day, \\u201cPap\\u00e1, come on the radio with me.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna talk about your show.\\u201d And he would help me sell out these shows year after year after year. So, Laz, I know you\\u2019re watching, Pap\\u00e1. Thank you. This is part of you, Pap\\u00e1. Muchas gracias. Thank you. Thank you. But that was many years down the line. In the beginning, the first time I performed at that comedy club, right outside these doors, that\\u2019s no longer there\\u2026 Um, I\\u2019m talking to the marketing person. Now, keep in mind, this is so long ago, there was no social media. There was no TikTok, no freaking Twitter, no Facebook, none of that. The only way you could promote yourself back then was, you had to get on morning radio, morning news, have somebody do a write-up on you in the newspaper. Remember those? Yeah. And then, of course, word-of-mouth, which is always the best. Uh, they had posters at the comedy club. And so, the marketing guy goes, \\u201cGabriel.\\u201d \\u201cHelp me help you help us.\\u201d \\u201cWe want to sell tickets. How do you want to be promoted?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWell\\u2026\\u201d Keep in mind, long time ago. I said, \\u201cUm, this is how I want you to promote my show.\\u201d \\u201cPlease use a photo.\\u201d \\u201cUnder the photo, put my name, Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t have the nickname Fluffy yet. That\\u2019s how long ago this was. I said, \\u201cUnderneath that, please put, \\u2018As seen on Comedy Central.'\\u201d Because at the time, that was the only television credit I had. So the marketing guy goes, \\u201cWell, I was thinking, what about, \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and his amigos\\u2019?\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201c\\u2018Amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWhy \\u2018amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cBecause I have other Mexicans with me?\\u201d And he looked at me and said, \\u201cGood. You get it.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like that. What about \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and friends\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWell, we want to put a couple of buzzwords out there to let the community know what type of show it is.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat type of show is it?\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cIt\\u2019s a special show.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel special.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cGabriel, hear me out. What about like a taco Tuesday?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cOkay, what about salsa night?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cSalsa night?\\u201d \\u201cWait, like dancing or chips and guac?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cEither one, I don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d I could not believe I was having this conversation, and I wanted to get upset. I wanted to go off on this guy for trying to make me feel like less of a person, right? But I didn\\u2019t, because I knew that if I went off on them, I would have been seen as difficult. I would have been seen as a problem, and I would not have been given another opportunity to come back. When people ask me, \\u201cWhat do you credit for your success?\\u201d Of course, talent, showing up, doing what you gotta do. But one word that gets left out a lot is the word \\u201csacrifice.\\u201d I had to sacrifice something that day, and a lot of people think they know what sacrifice means but honestly, until you have to make one, I don\\u2019t think you do. I had to sacrifice my pride because as much as I wanted to go off on this guy, I knew that if I did, I\\u2019d be shooting myself in the foot. I knew that if they could see what I could do on that stage, they\\u2019d have to bring me back, and they\\u2019d have to treat me different.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo as much as it hurt, as much as it sucked, I allowed that stupid taco Tuesday to happen. So, for me, I was very upset. I was wondering, is this something that happens to all new comedians, or was I being singled out? It was killing me. I needed to know. I couldn\\u2019t just take out my phone and google it because that wasn\\u2019t an option all those years back. So what I had to do was I had to go to the front door of the club where they had a bin, and the bin had flyers in it. So I grabbed the flyer, and I looked at it. And the flyer had the list of upcoming comedy shows. And I was so upset when I saw it because all it was, was pictures, names, and television credits. No silly names, no theme nights, no \\u201cspicy this\\u201d or \\u201ccrazy that.\\u201d Just comedy. So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this stupid taco Tuesday thing to me?\\u201d So I said, \\u201cLet me try to find another comedian who\\u2019s a little bit more in my vein.\\u201d If you know what I mean. The only other comedian I could find was a man by the name of George Lopez.\\n[audience cheers]\\nWith George\\u2019s promo, however, it was just a picture, name, and underneath that, a television credit that said, \\u201cAs seen on ABC.\\u201d That\\u2019s it. It didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cLikes to ride a donkey, George Lopez,\\u201d \\u201cEats a burrito with both hands, George Lopez.\\u201d \\u201cAy, ay, ay. I just jumped the wall. It\\u2019s George Lopez.\\u201d No! So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this to me?\\u201d So then I said, \\u201cAll right, all right.\\u201d \\u201cLet me see how they promote the Black comedians.\\u201d And with the Black comedians, it was the same thing. Picture, name, television credit, and that\\u2019s it. Unless it was a show that had multiple Black comedians on it because if the comedy club had a show with three or more Black comics on it, they would put a catchy name to it. They would call the show \\u201cUrban Night\\u201d or \\u201cApollo Night\\u201d or \\u201cDef Jam Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBET Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBlack-ish Comedy Night.\\u201d But that\\u2019s as far as they would go. They wouldn\\u2019t go to the next level like they would for me. Oh, yeah. There was no \\u201cMargarita Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTaco Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWetback Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTortilla Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFiesta Friday,\\u201d or \\u201cS\\u00e1bado Gigante\\u201d! No. That would never happen to Black people. Are you kidding me? You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMalt Liquor Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTupac Tuesday,\\u201d or \\u201cWatermelon Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cThong, Th-Thong, Thong Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFried Chicken Friday\\u201d or \\u201cSookie-Sookie Saturday\\u201d or \\u201cSlap-a-Ho Sunday\\u201d!\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nAnd that most definitely will not happen to white people. [audience chuckling] [scattered cheers] [speaks inaudibly] [cheering grows louder] Oh, I\\u2019mma do the joke. And you know why you can laugh and enjoy and not feel threatened by what I\\u2019m about to say? Because, like what I said earlier tonight, I am here to entertain, I am not here to offend. I\\u2019m here to have fun with everybody, starting with me. Plus, it\\u2019ll never happen. You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMonster Truck Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTrailer Park Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWhite Trash Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTake Your Sister Out Thursday.\\u201d [audience laughs] [in Southern accent] \\u201cOh, hell no, Fluffy! You done crossed the line now!\\u201d \\u201cMy name is Dustin, and I don\\u2019t play that shit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m from Davie, goddammit.\\u201d [audience cheers] Next time, stay quiet. [audience laughs] So\\u2026 I was talking to Martin backstage before I came out, and he goes, \\u201cAre you gonna share the story about the theme nights thing that happened at The Improv here, and y\\u2019know?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, y\\u2019know, I think I should, Martin.\\u201d \\u201cI think I should tell the story about, y\\u2019know, the theme nights.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cGabe, can I tell you something about that theme nights bit?\\u201d I go, \\u201cTell me, Martin.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cDo you realize that in all the years I have heard you tell this story about what happened at that club, do you understand that you\\u2019ve never once finished the week?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cMartin, you know why that is, right?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s the rule of comedy.\\u201d \\u201cYou always want to end on the biggest laugh.\\u201d \\u201cThursday gets the biggest laugh, which is why I stopped at Thursday.\\u201d And Martin goes, \\u201cI know, I know, I know.\\u201d \\u201cBut you\\u2019re robbing white people of their week.\\u201d [audience laughs] I never looked at it that way. \\u201cFox News Friday.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cStorm the Capitol Saturday.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cSay You\\u2019re Sorry Sunday\\u201d! [audience cheers] Are we still havin\\u2019 a good time? [audience cheers] Are we still having fun? [cheering grows louder] That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. People laughing, not getting upset, not getting offended, not freakin\\u2019 making a stink. And let me tell you right now, for the five people who have never heard of me before, this\\u2026 is for you. [scattered cheers] I get pulled over one night, two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-through. [audience cheering knowingly] I made a left turn instead of making a right turn, but I wasn\\u2019t paying attention, \\u2019cause I had a box, right? I was like, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d [chuckles enthusiastically] [exclaims, chuckles] \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d I make a wrong turn all of a sudden. [imitates siren] [groans] [imitates vehicle approaching] [grunts sadly] \\u201cLater.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[gibbers indistinctly] The officer is taking forever. I said, \\u201cForget this.\\u201d I grab the box of donuts. I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. I was like\\u2026 [inhales sharply] Mm! [chuckles] Ah! [exclaims wildly] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou know why I stopped you?\\u201d It was too easy. I picked up the box, and I said\\u2026 [with audience] \\u201c\\u2018Cause you can smell it!\\u201d [audience cheering] [crowd chanting] Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! [audience continues cheering] [chime dings] [Gabriel] You\\u2019re probably wondering, why did we pause the special again? Well, I just want to let you guys know most comedians would\\u2019ve already said, \\u201cThank you, good night,\\u201d gone home, cashed their Netflix checks, and hope they get another phone call. \\u201cPlease call me, Netflix.\\u201d [inhales] But this guy is not most comedians. That\\u2019s what happens when you hire a Mexican. We love overtime. [audience cheering] Thank you for still wanting to hear a joke that\\u2019s over 20 years old. [audience cheers] I grew up watching you too. [audience laughs] Got chills when I\\u2026 [in Spanish] Look, look. [audience laughs] [in English] That was beautiful. I love you too, and that\\u2026 Seriously, you guys, thank you for that. Thank you. [audience cheers] Thank you. There are fans, and then there\\u2019s what you just did right now. [audience cheering] I don\\u2019t know any other comedian that gets this type of love and loyalty. Thank you so much. I\\u2019m not getting off the stage yet \\u2019cause I still got more to go, but I want to say thank you for that. [audience cheers] Thank you. [sighs dramatically]\\n[audience cheering]\\n[Gabriel] Whoo! So when I started doing stand-up in 1997, the only place that would allow me to go up on stage and do what I do were bars. Dive bars, rough bars. Uh, Martin and I, that\\u2019s where we met, many, many years ago. We\\u2019re performing at this bar in Montebello, California, and, uh, you had to fight with the crowd. You had to fight because there was noise. There were TVs on. People were drinking, smoking\\u2026 People were doing everything in there but paying attention. So you had to come out quick, trying to get them to laugh. And one night, this comedian pulls me aside, and he goes, \\u201cHey, kid.\\u201d And when he called me kid, I got upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI could drink.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was 20, 21 years old, and, you know, even though I thought I was grown, I wasn\\u2019t. I wasn\\u2019t grown. Uh, I got upset that he pulled me aside. He goes, \\u201cCan I give you some advice?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWho does this guy think he is? I\\u2019m funnier than him.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I thought because at the age of 21, I was a punk. I really was. And so, I don\\u2019t know what got into me where I said, \\u201cSure, I\\u2019ll hear you out.\\u201d And I just stood there, and he said, \\u201cListen.\\u201d \\u201cUm, you\\u2019re really likeable on stage, and that\\u2019s rare.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna give you a bit of advice.\\u201d \\u201cIf you cut all the cussing out of your show and start taking the filthy material out, I think you\\u2019re gonna have a long career ahead of you.\\u201d And I know I said \\u201ctake the cussing out\\u201d and I\\u2026 I said the F-word twice tonight. [audience chuckles] Technically, no, three times. I said it three times. Um, but I\\u2019m mindful of it. I\\u2019m keeping count. It\\u2019s not every other word. Plus, we\\u2019re in a casino. [audience cheers] Okay. No one loses their ass and says, \\u201cAw, shucks.\\u201d No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI heard some of you cussing before. \\u201cWhen the fuck is this gonna start?\\u201d Yeah, I heard you. I heard you. [in Spanish] I\\u2019m fat, not deaf. [in English] I heard you, goddammit. So anyway, he gives me this advice. Cut the cussing out of your show, take out the filthy material. And I don\\u2019t know why I listen, but I did, and he was absolutely right. All of a sudden, I started getting opportunities left and right. I started getting booked at colleges, high schools, churches, fairs. And then the big one, casinos. [audience cheers] [cheering fades] Back in the day, you had to be squeaky-clean to perform at a casino. Uh, but that\\u2019s not the case anymore. If you can sell tickets, it doesn\\u2019t matter what you do, they want to book you. But back in the day, there was only a few people who could pull it off. I was fortunate to be one of those people. So I remember, I got booked to perform at a casino called Morongo in Southern California, and I\\u2019m backstage with the booker, the lady that hired me for the function, and she goes, \\u201cSo, no cussing, right?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. No cussing.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cNo filthy material?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNo filthy material.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cGood luck.\\u201d And it was just me. I didn\\u2019t have openers. It was just me. It was a voice-over on the frickin\\u2019 speaker, right? \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome comedian, funny man Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d And then I just\\u2026 I walked out there, right? I offended the entire audience\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026in five seconds. And I did it without cussing. Frickin\\u2019 22-year-old kid goes up on stage, looks at the crowd and says, \\u201cHey, everybody! Is this a regular casino, or is this an Indian casino?\\u201d [audience groans and laughs] You see how you all know?\\n[audience laughs]\\nI didn\\u2019t know. I didn\\u2019t know because I didn\\u2019t have TikTok to teach me. [audience chuckles] What I did have was a life experience that I\\u2019ll never forget. As soon as I said that, the entire front row, which comprised of the tribal members from the casino, they all stood up, and one of them called me out in front of the entire audience. \\u201cHey! Hey! You don\\u2019t say that anymore!\\u201d \\u201cThe proper term is Native American.\\u201d \\u201cPlease show respect.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh my God. I\\u2019m so sorry. I didn\\u2019t know.\\u201d And I felt horrible, and I was so embarrassed. Fortunately, I had a second show at ten o\\u2019clock. Ten o\\u2019clock hits. I take the stage. I didn\\u2019t need to be told a thousand times that I messed up. That one time of me getting shamed in front of the entire audience was all I needed. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m a firm believer in shaming. [audience laughs] I think shaming is good. Shaming is good as long as you shame with purpose. If you\\u2019re about to teach someone a valuable lesson, I say go for it because it worked for me. I got shamed one time. Second show, ten o\\u2019clock. I took the stage. Ooh, it was different. I was like, \\u201cBefore I get started, ladies and gentlemen, I\\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Native Americans who are here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cThank you for this opportunity to perform in your casino.\\u201d \\u201cI hope you enjoy the performance.\\u201d [audience cheers and laughs] I thought I was good. All of a sudden, another tribal member in the back jumped up. And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey, drop the \\u2018American\\u2019! Just say \\u2018Native\\u2019!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201c\\u2018Kay!\\u201d [audience laughs] That stayed with me. That was powerful. That was scary. Next time I did a casino, first thing I said was, \\u201cI would like to acknowledge all of the Natives who are here tonight,\\u201d and then someone yelled out, \\u201cWe\\u2019re Indigenous!\\u201d Fuck me! That\\u2019s four. [audience laughs and cheers] [chime dings] With time, I got a chance to perform all across the United States, and then I get my first-ever show in Canada. Ironically enough, at a casino. [audience laughs] It\\u2019s a casino we still perform at called Caesars in the city of Windsor, Ontario, right across the water from Detroit, Michigan. [audience cheers] I come to find out the hard way that in Canada, it is a completely different term for describing the\\u2026 people\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026originally from that land. The proper term in Canada is actually \\u201cFirst Nation.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t know that. I was so nervous being in Canada, I said, \\u201cNative American.\\u201d [audience laughs] Like, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I\\u2019m not even in America, right? Frickin\\u2019 stupid, right? Pendejo, I know. [audience laughs] Fortunately, someone pulled me to the side, and they told me what was up. I was lucky that I had a second show. Ten o\\u2019clock, I take the stage, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBefore I begin, I would like to acknowledge all of the First Nation people who are here tonight.\\u201d Then some guy yells out, \\u201cCall us Indians!\\u201d [audience laughs] This guy in the front row was like\\u2026 [in Indian accent] \\u201cThey\\u2019re not Indian.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[in Indian accent] \\u201cThey are not Indian!\\u201d [as self] Canada has always been an adventure. There was one show that we did at the same casino. Anytime now, we perform outside of the United States, even if it\\u2019s next door in Canada or Mexico, Martin\\u2019s first question to the audience is, \\u201cDo we have any Americans in the house tonight?\\u201d Because no matter where we perform in the world, there\\u2019s always a handful. So that night, Martin takes the stage, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans here tonight?\\u201d Not knowing that earlier in the day, at that same casino, in the grand ballroom, there was a\\u2026 a end-of-year holiday party from an American company from right across the water in Detroit. And they were having this end-of-year celebration, and they were there, pre-gaming since noon. [audience chuckles] Partying it up. And I guess the\\u2026 the party planner for the event thought it would be an amazing idea to end their party with laughter. So this person bought all of the tickets to my show that night and gave them to that company. Well, seven o\\u2019clock rolls around, and everybody stumbles in, takes their seats, and then Martin walks out, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans?\\u201d And instead of getting a \\u201cYay,\\u201d \\u201cWhoo,\\u201d \\u201cRight here,\\u201d he got\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] They were so drunk, they started chanting. \\u201cUSA! USA! USA! USA!\\u201d I\\u2019m in the dressing room, hearing this. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are we here?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cWe could have done this in Detroit.\\u201d You know? I had to fill out paperwork. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis is not cool.\\u201d So during intermission, Martin comes backstage and he tells me, \\u201cBro, I don\\u2019t know if you heard\\u2026\\u201d [as self] \\u201cOh, I heard.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cMight wanna mention it.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOh, I will.\\u201d So at some point during my performance, I told the audience, \\u201cSo, a little bird told me there might be a couple of Americans here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cIs that true?\\u201d Sure enough\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] And they started doing it again. [chanting] \\u201cUSA! USA! USA!\\u201d Then it got quiet, and you could hear, \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, do you understand what just happened?\\u201d \\u201cWe just made history.\\u201d And people in the front row, they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about, history?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWe just made history.\\u201d \\u201cWho would have ever thought you\\u2019d see the day where thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of Americans would cross a border\\u2026\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\u2026to see a Mexican?\\u201d\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you for 27 years of supporting this Mexican.\\n[in Spanish] Miami, I love you so much.

Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\\u2013 There\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all.\\n\\u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\\u201d\\nI live\\u2013 I live in New York. I always\\u2013 Like, there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\\u2019s always walking her dog. She\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\\u2013 The two of them, it\\u2019s really\\u2013 The dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\\u2013 And she\\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\\u201910\\u201d, But now it\\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \\u201cyecch, no thank you. \\u201cI do not want those. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \\u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\\u2019s no\\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \\u201cgood morning, gladys,\\u201d She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cgood,\\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \\u201c\\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n\\u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\\u201d\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\\u2019s a weird moment, too, \\u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \\u201cyeah, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \\u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \\u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \\u201cwhy did he die, da\\u2013\\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\\u2019s the reason. That\\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead. He didn\\u2019t know his name, and he didn\\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\\u2019t know which one. I don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\\u2019t. They don\\u2019t care, and we don\\u2019t care. There\\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \\u201cok, everybody. \\u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\\u2013you know what?\\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\\u201d And we would all be like, \\u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\\u201d Anyway, so we\\u2019re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\\u2019s going\\u2013 They\\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \\u201cbaa,\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\\u2019re like\\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 They go\\u2013 My daughter\\u2019s like, \\u201cwhat is he saying?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know! \\u201cI\\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\\u201d\\n\\u201cThe Food Chain\\u201d\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\\u2019re in the food chain. You\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\\u2019s how all life ends, is\\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \\u201cI love you. Bye.\\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \\u201cbeh,\\u201d and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cfine,\\u201d And it\\u2019s just, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\\u2019t get it! Then you\\u2019re walking to work like, \\u201cwhy do I even bother? \\u201cshit! Goddamn it! \\u201cthere\\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\\u201d You think that sharks\\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\\u2019d be bummed \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \\u201chey, nobody has any idea what\\u2019s down here,\\u201d And we\\u2019re all up here like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s totally a shark right there.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\\u2013 \\u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\\u2019s why animals just\\u2013 They go, \\u201clet\\u2019s do this together, man. \\u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\\u201d That\\u2019s why they do it like that. \\u201cfuck it. I\\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cgrownups ain\\u2019t worth the meat.\\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n\\u201cCourtyard Confrontation\\u201d\\nI live in New York city, and it\\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\\u2019m not used to it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\\u2019t get a fountain made without\\u2013 \\u201ccan you make me a fountain?\\u201d \\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll get started right away! \\u201cYes! Yes! It\\u2019s finished!\\u201d And it\\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \\u201cjust piss on me forever!\\u201d Anyway, there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\\u2026 And so I\\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\\u2019s looking at me like, \\u201c\\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \\u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \\u201c\\u201d And then I see him go, \\u201cno. That\\u2019s not gonna do at all,\\u201d And he comes over to me, \\u201c\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNum num num!\\u201d I\\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \\u201crrgh!\\u201d So he comes over, says, \\u201cexcuse me, \\u201cdo you live in this building?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there? I said, \\u201cno.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI just need to rest. I\\u2019m having a hard time.\\u201d He says, \\u201cthis is private property,\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, I don\\u2019t really believe in that.\\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t leave, I\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\\u201d I was like, \\u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\\u201d So he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno,\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \\u201cno. That guy lives here. It\\u2019s OK,\\u201d And the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\\u2013 It was just so\\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings. That\\u2019s how excited I was.\\n\\u201cGetting What \\u2018Old\\u2019 Is\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m 45 now, So I\\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\\u2019t know which one. I won\\u2019t know till it\\u2019s over where this was. I don\\u2019t know how long I\\u2019m gonna live. I don\\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad.\\u201d If I die five years from now, they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cwell, all right,\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 It\\u2019s\\u2013 Like, as soon as you\\u2019re 50, you\\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\\u2019re in the news, and it\\u2019s always some old guy, \\u201cI met Napoleon.\\u201d No, you didn\\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwow, this seems early for this.\\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\\u2019ll realize, \\u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\\u2019s just like, \\u201cJust\\u2013 \\u201d My asshole\\u2013 My asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \\u201crats.\\u201d That\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\\u2019m\\u2013 OK. Say I\\u2019m sitting down. If I\\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\\u2013ha ha ha!\\u2013 I love sitting so much\\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\\u2013 At my age, if I\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \\u201cwhat? Why do I\\u2013 no. Why, though?\\u201d \\u201cYour car is being towed right now!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\\u2019s\\u2013 I accept that.\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \\u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\\u201d Like, let\\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \\u201c\\u201d like I\\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \\u201cshit.\\u201d\\n\\u201cPutting On Socks\\u201d\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\\u2013 Here\\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\\u2019t even know how I do it. I\\u2019m sitting here. I don\\u2019t know how I do that. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 It\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\\u2013 I\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \\u201cbeep, beep, beep!\\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \\u201cOK. That\\u2019s hard.\\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n\\u201cIf You\\u2019re Older You\\u2019re Smarter\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right. It means that even if they\\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\\u2019ve been there longer. If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\\u2019s the interesting thing. There\\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\\u2019t clap. Why? \\u2019cause they\\u2019re smart. They\\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to clap. I don\\u2019t have to do anything.\\u201d They\\u2019re not doing it, and they\\u2019re right. You know why? \\u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m asking. How do you know what\\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\\u2019s every time. \\u201cWhoo! Whoo!\\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\\u2019re not the only people here. That\\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\\u2013 \\u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\\u2019t have it! I don\\u2019t have it!\\u201d If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \\u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\\u2019s seen more. He\\u2019s seen history. He\\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \\u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \\u201cthe president\\u2019s kind of disappointing.\\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n\\u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\\u201d\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \\u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \\u201chey, I\\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\\u201d \\u201cso where do I\\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\\u2019d like to make one of those \\u201cit gets better\\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \\u201clisten, man. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s tough right now. \\u201cYou\\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \\u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \\u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \\u201cbut it gets better because you\\u2019ll all grow up, \\u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \\u201cand they don\\u2019t. \\u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \\u201cand you\\u2019re gonna be there. \\u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \\u201cbefore she hits the ground. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna be so great. \\u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \\u201cto match your looks, but it\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cWhen real shit matters, you\\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\\u201d It\\u2019s just time. That\\u2019s all it takes. There\\u2019s a formula to this. It\\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n\\u201cEverybody Has Their Time\\u201d\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone.\\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\\u2019s all that happens, \\u201caww,\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \\u201cAww.\\u201d Well, go fuck one. \\u201cNah.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t think so. That\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \\u201cyeah. No. You should. I\\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\\u201d\\n\\u201cDating Takes Courage\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\\u2013 It\\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\\u2019t do this!\\u201d But he walked up and said, \\u201chi. Yes,\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\\u201d Sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\\u2019s the whole thing. That\\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \\u201cdude, I can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\\u201d But women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah. I\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\\u201d What are you, nuts? \\u201cI\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\\u201d \\u201cTo your death, statistically.\\u201d How do they still do it? If you\\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI hope this one\\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFirst Date\\u201d\\nI always\\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together And she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha! \\u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\\u2026\\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cthat was good. He\\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\\u201d And he has no idea. He\\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there.\\n\\u201cTits\\u201d\\nGuys are\\u2013 We love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 And we just look at you. That\\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Like they\\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \\u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\\u201d And 100% of us will go, \\u201cyes, of course.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \\u201cyeah. Ok.\\u201d Beep! \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019s not your tits. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 You don\\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit. \\u201cthank you, Deborah. I\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\\u201d It\\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d Which I don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d But that\\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d There\\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that!\\u201d \\u201cthe end.\\u201d \\u201cmy god! \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\\u2013 And you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \\u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\\u201d That\\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\\u2019s, once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\\u2019t get the second one. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit.\\u201d \\u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \\u201cI like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\\u201d And if it\\u2019s up to the guy, we\\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \\u201cyou know what? \\u201cI\\u2019m good with the one. That\\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\\u201d We\\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 \\u201cyeah\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cthere\\u2019s a bomb!\\u201d \\u201cshit! Come on, let\\u2019s get\\u2013 \\u201ccome on! Let\\u2019s get your tits out of here!\\u201d\\n\\u201cDivorce\\u201d\\nI\\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\\u2019ve seen\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 48 maybe. I don\\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\\u2019m not saying don\\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\\u2019s the best part. It\\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \\u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\\u2019s over. I can\\u2019t take it.\\u201d And again, if you\\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\\u2019s just a fact. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s true. Everything\\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\\u2019m a good father. I\\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \\u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\\u2019s like every parent\\u2019s fantasy. Who can\\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \\u201cgood-bye, girls. \\u201cDaddy\\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m such a good dad.\\n\\u201cVideoing Your Kids\\u201d\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\\u2019s there, and everybody\\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \\u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 There\\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \\u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \\u201cmy god! \\u201cit\\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\\u201d And guess what? They\\u2019re not watching it, either. They\\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \\u201cthat\\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\\u201d Nobody\\u2019s watching your kids\\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\\u201d\\n\\u201cLife Is A Good Deal\\u201d\\nDon\\u2019t tape shit on your\\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 Here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything, You just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Every time I\\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \\u201cI could die right now,\\u201d and I mean it! That\\u2019s how good life is. You get to\\u2013 you get to fuck. That\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\\u2019s your buddy. If you\\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\\u2019m not worried about it ending.\\n\\u201cBehind The Wheel\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty good, and I\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\\u2019t know. You know, it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\\u2019re driving, That\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \\u201cworthless piece of shit.\\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \\u201cWorthless piece of shit\\u201d? That\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son. And things I\\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 I don\\u2019t remember, even\\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d? \\u201cworthless piece of shit!\\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d I said that to a person. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d Why? \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\\u2019d like to think that I\\u2019m a nice person, But I don\\u2019t know, man.\\n\\u201cIf Murder Was Legal\\u201d\\nA lot of it is context. There\\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019d love to think, \\u201cI would never do that,\\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause, Like, \\u201cI would never do that.\\u201d No. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\\u2019t like them. \\u201cI never killed anybody.\\u201d \\u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \\u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\\u201d \\u201cI think he\\u2019s nice.\\u201d \\u201cshut up, Janet.\\u201d They would just\\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\\u2019d go to a mall, there\\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\\u2019t listen to me!\\u201d Just\\u2013pbbt! There\\u2019d be just\\u2013 You\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross. \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment. \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of America. \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n\\u201cOf Course, But Maybe\\u201d\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\\u2013 That\\u2019s the thing I believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing, and I don\\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \\u201cof course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \\u201chow did they build those pyramids?\\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\\u2019re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \\u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm\\u2026 It\\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\\u2026 is \\u201cFuck you.\\u201d \\u201cFuck you. I don\\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\\u201d \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m straight up jealous. I\\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\\u2019s coming. You don\\u2019t have HPV yet, you\\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\\u2019s undetectable in men. It\\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\\u2019s bodies and says, \\u201cBoo!\\u201d in women\\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\\u2026 \\u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\\u2019m gonna die\\u2026 or you\\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\\u2019ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I\\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\\u2019m a horrible person, I\\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \\u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\\u2019t even know\\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \\u201cYou never know when you might need this.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cBut\\u2026 I do know\\u2026 that I\\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\\u201d\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\\u2019s\\u2013 he\\u2019s much better looking than me, he\\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, who is that?\\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \\u201cOh, my God, I\\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\\u201d \\u201cGoing to trap his ass!\\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \\u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\\u201d When, really, it\\u2019s a public park\\u2026 \\u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\\u2026 \\u2026and has even accidentally let\\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \\u201cHey, wassup?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWassup?\\u201d And we\\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \\u201cHey, can you drop me off?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhere?\\u201d He was like, \\u201cAt the park.\\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \\u201cOh, no!\\u201d \\u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\\u201d\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\\u2019s\\u2026 too much. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\\u2019s very, you know, it\\u2019s hot hookin\\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\\u2026 \\u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\\u2026 And then also, he\\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\\u201d You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\\u2019s\\u2026 amazing. It\\u2019s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \\u201cHold it. You guys aren\\u2019t Mexican?\\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\\u2019t know why people don\\u2019t go for them. They\\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\\u201d \\u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\\u2026 \\u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\\u2019s\\u2026 It\\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\\u201d I was like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not authentic, OK?\\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \\u2019cause it don\\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\\u2019s like\\u2026 \\u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\\u2026 \\u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\\u2019s funny, right, because he\\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I\\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\\u2026 because\\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\\u2019s intuition. That\\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\\u2019re too old and it\\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \\u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \\u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\\u201d \\u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\\u2026 he\\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\\u2019s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\\u2019m a completely different person. You\\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\\u2019d become dependent on me. \\u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t. I straight up don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re dumb women. We don\\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\\u201d \\u201c\\u2018Cause we\\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \\u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\\u201d \\u201cBitch, shut up!\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell them the secret.\\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \\u201cDouble-income household,\\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\\u201d Oh, you don\\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\\u2019ll see on the street. And they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThat bitch is a genius.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a housewife, she\\u2019s retired.\\u201d\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\\u2019t gotta\\u2026 \\u2026ten times a day, every day\\u2026 like you\\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\\u2019t gotta do that. They don\\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \\u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \\u2019cause you\\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, no! Courtney\\u2019s listening. She\\u2019s waiting. She\\u2019s timing me.\\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it\\u2019s\\u2013 it\\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \\u201cYou need to get to work on time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYou need to eat bananas.\\u201d \\u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\\u201d\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \\u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \\u2018I do,\\u2019 what I really meant was, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m done.'\\u201d I\\u2019m done. I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\\u2026 Let\\u2019s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\\u2019m a\\u2013 I\\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\\u2019m a pervert. I\\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \\u201cUh, you\\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\\u2026 and posted \\u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\\u2026\\u2019 the Internet would crash.\\u201d \\u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t wanna do that. I\\u2019m scared of\\u2013 of the pain.\\u201d You ain\\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\\u2019re scared that he\\u2019s gonna see that and that\\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\\u2019t help you now. But don\\u2019t worry, \\u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\\u2019s thinking about is, \\u201cI just put it in her butt.\\u201d \\u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\\u201d You\\u2019re\\u2013 If you\\u2019re married, you\\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\\u2019ll feel like you\\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\\u2019m a little bit\\u2026 \\u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \\u201cOh, my God! It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m going back in time!\\u201d\\n\\u266a A whole new world \\u266a\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\\u2026 Now, if you haven\\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\\u2013 Just give your man a little\\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\\u2019ll get a lot of \\u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\\u2019t\\u2013 No! I don\\u2019t! I don\\u2019t! No!\\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\\u2026 they\\u2019re scared. They\\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\\u2019s eye like he\\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\\u2013 When I\\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \\u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\\u201d I\\u2019m, like, \\u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\\u201d \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\\u2013 It\\u2019s because we\\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t wanna die! Don\\u2019t kill me! I don\\u2019t wanna die!\\u201d But I also don\\u2019t want to be sure that I\\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\\u2019t talk. \\u2018Cause if I can talk, I\\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \\u201cbossy\\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\\u2019s sexist to use the word \\u201cbossy,\\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \\u201cYou\\u2019re bossy,\\u201d you\\u2019re supposed to say, \\u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a little cunt.\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\\u2019m talking about? I\\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\\u2019m striving for. That\\u2019s when you know you\\u2019ve made it, when you\\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\\u2026 \\u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don\\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\\u2026 don\\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\\u2019s\\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\\u2019s so annoying and boring.\\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \\u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\\u2019s head shredding it up. She\\u2019s busy. So, I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \\u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\\u2013 You\\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s the dream.\\u201d That\\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \\u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s cool\\u2026 until my husband dies.\\u201d Which he\\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\\u2019m a billion. I\\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \\u201cblack don\\u2019t crack.\\u201d Well, Asian don\\u2019t die. We don\\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\\u2019re trying to die. We\\u2019re like, \\u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\\u201d \\u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna make a right turn\\u2013 I changed my mind, it\\u2019s a U-turn!\\u201d \\u201cI changed my mind again. It\\u2019s a O-turn!\\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\\u2026 \\u2026I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh, my God, not again!\\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\\u2019t see that it\\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s wrong with me, but I\\u2019m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \\u2018Cause she knows that she\\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna recycle\\u2026 go bald\\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\\u201d They do that \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I\\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\\u2019m only 33 and\\u2026 \\u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\\u2026 \\u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know what kind of mother I\\u2019m gonna be. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \\u201cUh, mmm.\\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s crackin\\u2019? Mmm.\\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \\u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\\u2026\\u201d \\u201c\\u2026smell my fingers?\\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \\u2019cause you gotta check that it\\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \\u201cOh, my God, that\\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\\u2019 a lot of fuckin\\u2019?\\u201d No, dude. That\\u2019s\\u2013 That\\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\\u2013 When you\\u2019re in your 30s, and you\\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\\u2019. It tells you when it\\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not fuckin\\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Release the Kraken!'\\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\\u2019t even have sex, \\u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, it\\u2019s go time,\\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\\u2019s because they\\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \\u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\\u2019s when they get that\\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\\u2026 \\u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\\u2026 And then, because we\\u2019re hippies, I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\\u2019s right. \\u2018Cause I don\\u2019t wanna work anymore.\\nI\\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh, my God. That\\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d I\\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\\u2019re 33, you\\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\\u2013 She\\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \\u201cUh, yeah. Where I\\u2019m from, that\\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\\u2019s whatevs, OK?\\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \\u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\\u2019re having twins.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cNo!\\u201d And then she said, \\u201cBut what I don\\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cYes!\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \\u201cYou look.\\u201d \\u201cYou watch the whole thing.\\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI\\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\\u2019m\\u2013 I\\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\\u2019s a white hippie witch\\u2026 \\u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \\u201cAli, did you know that you\\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\\u201d I was like, \\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\\u201d I\\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\\u2013 that that happens because when you\\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \\u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\\u201d \\u201cNo!\\u201d \\u201cCan you water the plants?\\u201d \\u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\\u2019m busy makin\\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\\u2019 a foot? I didn\\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\\u201d\\nI can already see how there\\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\\u2019s appointments with me. \\u201cOh, my God. I can\\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\\u2019m the star of the show. There\\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\\u2019m not there. But he\\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\\u2019m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I\\u2013 I\\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\\u2019t believe that he\\u2019s worthy of another woman\\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\\u2019t know that. I didn\\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \\u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I\\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\\u2019s all wet again. But it\\u2019s different. It\\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \\u201cWhy is it different?\\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\\u2019s all wet again because my\\u2013 my body\\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\\u2019s not the same. When it\\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\\u2019s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I\\u2013 I, in\\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime.

From recounting his experiences with fame and evolving societal norms to navigating personal milestones like his relationships and the challenges of maintaining his authenticity, Iglesias crafts a deeply engaging narrative. The special reflects his belief in staying true to his comedic roots\\u2014focusing on entertainment without alienation\\u2014while touching on personal growth, his rise to international fame, and the enduring loyalty of his fans. Through hilarious retellings of real-life situations, including a robbery, his missteps in cultural sensitivity, and navigating life post-breakup, Iglesias showcases his ability to laugh at himself and find humor even in adversity. The show is a testament to his longevity, adaptability, and connection with audiences, offering both laughs and introspection.\\n* * *\\n[crowd cheering]\\n[crowd chanting]\\nFluffy!\\n[cheering stops]\\n[Gabriel] Man, look at this crowd.

Also, I would like to thank, since we\\u2019re here, Only in Dade. Thank you so much. If you know, you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] \\u2026and I think you know. [crowd chuckles] And also, to my friends over at La Carreta for all the food. So\\u2026\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYes. [laughing] Yeah, man. Before we get started, you guys, uh, I would like to thank the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino for the opportunity to record a special. No other entertainer has done a special here yet. Tonight is the first one.\\n[crowd cheering]\\nIt wasn\\u2019t the Rolling Stones. It wasn\\u2019t the Eagles. They trusted a comedian\\u2026 [crowd cheers] \\u2026to make this happen. So I wanna say thank you. Is anybody else staying here at the, uh\\u2026 at the Hard Rock? [crowd cheers] Hey, me too.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a beautiful hotel, and I\\u2019m not just saying that \\u2019cause my room is free. [audience laughs] You know you\\u2019re in a nice hotel and casino when you turn on your TV in your room and they have their own video. Like, if you\\u2019re staying here, you turn on the TV, you get this, [trills tongue] [feminine voice] \\u201cWelcome to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [moans seductively] \\u201cTwenty-four-hour gambling, seven days a week, 365 days a year.\\u201d [moans suggestively] I\\u2019m sitting there like, \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t I stop watching this?\\u201d And I started thinking, at this point, why don\\u2019t they just do that to the slot machines? You know? Gambling\\u2019s already shameless. Might as well go all the way. You walk up to one of the little machines, pop in a 20. [whirring] [moans loudly] [whirring, moans] [feminine voice] \\u201cDon\\u2019t stop.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [audience laughs] People are walking by. \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cTrying to get the jackpot!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] Yeah, man. I\\u2019m gonna start the show off tonight with a question. That\\u2019s not how comedy shows happen, but I\\u2019m gonna start it with a question. The question is, who here tonight has never heard of me up until tonight? [scattered cheering] Five. Two. Five. Okay. To those of you, the five of you, I say, \\u201cSorry.\\u201d I know you got excited. You saw the ticket. You saw the last name, and then I walked out. And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cEnrique got bigger.\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why I ask who has never seen or heard of me before is because if you have, then you know the type of show that I do. And you know the type of show that I don\\u2019t do. Like, I\\u2019m not here to tell you who to vote for, who not to vote for, what shot to take or what baby to get rid of. That\\u2019s not for me to say. If you\\u2019re already offended, you missed the point. I\\u2019m telling you what I\\u2019m not gonna do. I promise you, I am here to entertain, not offend. Okay? [audience cheers] We\\u2019re gonna have fun with everybody. Starting with me, but I\\u2019m gonna let you know, we\\u2019re living in a different time. I\\u2019ve been doing this so long, I always figured, as long as I\\u2019m being nice, I shouldn\\u2019t have any issues, but it\\u2019s a very different time. This is year 27 for me.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYeah. Twenty-seven years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I never had to worry. You know, when I first got started, shoot\\u2026 1997, I was clean-shaven, I had hair. I know. Look at some of you. \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d Huh? Vaccine. I know. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kid\\u2026 I\\u2019m kidding. Sorry, Florida. I\\u2019m kidding. I\\u2019m kidding. I said \\u201cVaccine,\\u201d some of you were like, \\u201cI told you!\\u201d Yeah. [crowd laughs] [in Spanish] \\u201cI told you. He said so.\\u201d [audience chuckles] [in English] Some friends tell me, \\u201cDude, man, you\\u2019re making money now. Why don\\u2019t you get the hair thingy?\\u201d I said, \\u201cFor what?\\u201d \\u201cWell, you know, some women, they want a guy with hair.\\u201d Well, good for them.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd they\\u2019re not lying. I have gone out with some women that made it a point to tell me that hair was important. One told me flat out, \\u201cI need to be able to run my fingers through your hair.\\u201d Yeah! And I told her, \\u201cHey, look, if you go deep enough\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026you\\u2019re gonna get your wish.\\u201d \\u201cYou were not specific on location. Hey.\\u201d \\u201cYou want hair, you want pelos, I got you.\\u201d But, yeah, 27 years of being a comedian. And in those 27 years, I have seen a lot of comedians come and go. And I feel very grateful that in all that time, we\\u2019ve still managed to maintain a certain level.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo I feel like we\\u2019re doing something right. Which feels weird to me, because now I feel like you gotta be very mindful. Okay? You gotta be extra mindful. Like\\u2026 Uh, 27 years of being a comedian, I finally started hearing people tell me things that I\\u2019ve never heard before. I started hearing people tell me things like, \\u201cHey, Fluffy. I grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience chuckles] Which is an incredible compliment because that doesn\\u2019t just say that you\\u2019re a fan, that says that you\\u2019re invested. That says that you\\u2019ve been following this career for a very long time. Some of you, the first time you saw me perform, you were kids. [audience cheers] And now some of you are here tonight with your kids. [audience cheers] And so, I just want to say thank you for all those years of trust and continuing to come back to see the show. It means a lot. [audience cheers and applauds] Hearing someone say they grew up watching me, that is one of the most beautiful compliments any entertainer can receive. And I understand that now, with therapy, that that\\u2019s what that means.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nLook, I\\u2019m not gonna lie. The first time I heard someone tell me that they grew up watching me, I didn\\u2019t know how to handle it. I didn\\u2019t know how to process because nobody wants to feel like they\\u2019re getting\\u2026 old. The first time I heard it, I was like\\u2026 [gasps dramatically] Second time I heard it, I was like, \\u201cBuy a hat.\\u201d The third time, I accepted it. I was like, [as old white man\\u2019] \\u201cMany years ago, when I first got started, all of this was land as far as the eye could see.\\u201d \\u201cIt was a very different time, and\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I don\\u2019t know why my old voice is white. [audience laughs] He just is. I tried doing the Mexican voice, but you don\\u2019t take him as serious. [in Spanish] \\u201cWell, screw you.\\u201d \\u201cWe were at the ranch, and were told to fuck off, dude.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s very tough out there.\\u201d [in English] But times are changing. The rules are changing. So I don\\u2019t know how much longer this is gonna be okay. I\\u2019ll tell you what happened to me and why I brought that up. I did a podcast. And before I went into the studio, I\\u2019m talking to the producer outside. And the producer\\u2019s excited and happy, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cGabriel Iglesias, we\\u2019re so excited to have you.\\u201d \\u201cThis is really cool.\\u201d \\u201cBefore you go in, the host wanted me to ask you something before you go in for your interview.\\u201d I go, \\u201cSure, go for it.\\u201d \\u201cOkay. What do you identify as?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I wasn\\u2019t sure how to answer that. I\\u2019m 47 years old. I didn\\u2019t know what to say. I was like, \\u201cShit. Hungry, I guess.\\u201d\\nI mean\\u2026\\n[audience laughs] I\\u2019m tired, sleepy, depressed on Tuesdays. I don\\u2019t know what you want me to say. See, here\\u2019s the thing. I knew what she was trying to ask me. I just wasn\\u2019t trying to get involved in a conversation about something that has absolutely nothing to do with me. This was\\u2026 Yeah. [audience cheers] I felt like I was being baited because no matter how I answered that question, I was gonna find myself in an awkward situation. So you know, because for me, I was just like, \\u201cLet me just be funny.\\u201d But nowadays, you can\\u2019t just not answer the question because silence is seen as a problem. And I\\u2019m sorry if me not answering a certain question is considered a problem. I was brought up during a time where you were constantly told to mind your business.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s all I\\u2019m trying to do is stay in my lane. Another thing we were constantly told was always respect your elders. [audience cheers] And no matter what generation you were from, that was at least the one thing we could always agree on until now. Now older people are seen as a problem. They are. You know, and I understand the youth of today has the technology in the palm of their hands, and you can google just about anything, but you cannot google life experience. Okay? You can\\u2019t. You can\\u2019t download struggling. You can\\u2019t download failure. You can\\u2019t download these moments that help build you up to make you a better person. And so again, for me, I chose to stay in my lane and just crack jokes when the girl asked me the question. She got very upset. She got very offended. As soon as I cracked the joke, she was like, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not what I mean.\\u201d \\u201cI mean what are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat are your pronouns?\\u201d \\u201cFor example, are you a they or them?\\u201d \\u201cA they\\u201d? [audience chuckles] \\u201cOr a them\\u201d? [audience laughs] \\u201cHow fat am I?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhen did I stop being an it?\\u201d Apparently, I ate myself into a plural. That\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience chuckles and applauds]\\nWhat I\\u2019m finding is, even if you have good intentions, and you\\u2019re trying to be cool, you can still find yourself in a situation. So, I\\u2019ll tell you what else happened to me, m\\u2019kay? I was at a McDonald\\u2019s. [audience chuckles] That\\u2019s not even the joke, but okay. [audience laughs] All righty. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cHere, this is gonna be good.\\u201d No, no! I was at a McDonald\\u2019s by my house. The McDonald\\u2019s by my house is actually a twofer. It\\u2019s a McDonald\\u2019s on the corner, and it\\u2019s also a gas station. I got a big SUV. I knew it was gonna be a minute. So I said, \\u201cLet me go get some nuggets while I\\u2019m here.\\u201d I walk into the McDonald\\u2019s, and as I\\u2019m walking in, I couldn\\u2019t help but notice this homeless family sitting right outside. Now, they didn\\u2019t have a sign. They did not ask me for money, but you could just tell. You could just tell that this poor family is dealing with life. So I get inside, and I said, \\u201cYou know what?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t need anything to eat.\\u201d \\u201cI really don\\u2019t. At this point, it\\u2019s just the habit.\\u201d [audience laughs] I get to the register, and I say, \\u201cYou know what? Let me order some food for the family.\\u201d \\u201cThey got kids with them.\\u201d So I placed an order and the cashier\\u2019s like, \\u201cAnything else?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes. Do you have, um\\u2026 um, Wet-Naps?\\u201d \\u201cExcuse me?\\u201d \\u201cYou know, Wet-Naps to clean your hands.\\u201d \\u201cSir, you\\u2019re more than welcome to use the restroom.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll give you the code.\\u201d \\u201cHere\\u2019s the thing.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s not for me. It\\u2019s for the homeless family that\\u2019s right outside the door.\\u201d \\u201cI want to make sure that the little kids can clean their hands before they eat.\\u201d \\u201cThis food that I just ordered is for them.\\u201d And as we\\u2019re talking\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you. As we\\u2019re talking, the manager at the McDonald\\u2019s is listening in to our conversation. And she walks over. And she\\u2019s all nosy, right? She\\u2019s like, \\u201cExcuse me. I couldn\\u2019t help but overhear.\\u201d \\u201cDid you just say that this food is for the family outside?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I hope that\\u2019s okay.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, it is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cGiving food to people who need food is definitely okay.\\u201d \\u201cHowever, what you just called them is not okay.\\u201d [audience groans] [as self] \\u201cWhat did I call them?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cYou said\\u2026 homeless.\\u201d [as self] \\u201c\\u2018Cause they are! Look. Shit.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cHe\\u2019s lickin\\u2019 the window!\\u201d [audience laughs] [as manager] \\u201cYou can\\u2019t say that word. It\\u2019s considered offensive.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWho complained?\\u201d \\u201cOkay, well, if I\\u2019m not supposed to say the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019 anymore, what am I supposed to say instead of the word \\u2018homeless\\u2019?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cThe new politically correct term is actually \\u2018unhoused\\u2019 when describing someone in an unfortunate situation like that.\\u201d [audience jeering] [as self] \\u201cYou\\u2019re kidding.\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cNo, sir. I\\u2019m not kidding. And please lower your voice.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYou want me to lower my voice when you\\u2019re saying something so ridiculous?\\u201d [as manager] \\u201cIf you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly, you are part of the problem, not the solution.\\u201d [audience chuckling] Oh, Miami. I wanted to get ghetto. [audience cheers] I wanted to get ghetto. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I wanted to go full Hialeah on them. [audience cheering] [man] Love you, Fluffy! Thank you for coming, Hialeah. [audience cheers] So yeah, I wanted to go off on her, but I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I wanted to get ghetto, but I couldn\\u2019t because that is the regular McDonald\\u2019s I go to.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nYou know what I\\u2019m saying? I\\u2019m not trying to get banned. The next one\\u2019s far, and gas is a bitch, so I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNah.\\u201d So I looked at her, and I said, \\u201cOkay. We\\u2019re gonna play this game?\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s play this game.\\u201d \\u201cFrom now on, I\\u2019m no longer fat.\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201cAccording to you, I am now \\u2018unexercised.'\\u201d [audience laughs] [audience cheering] I did, bro. She looked at me, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t be ridiculous.\\u201d And I looked at her, and I was like, \\u201cOh!\\u201d \\u201cOh, well, if you think it\\u2019s ridiculous, then clearly you are part of the problem.\\u201d \\u201cNot the solution.\\u201d [audience cheers] And I grabbed the food, and I walked out. Now, second half of the story. I walk over to the family. M\\u2019kay? And I hand the bags of food to the mom. And the mom was so nice. She was just happy that someone thought of her and her kids. She got very emotional. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI just want to say thank you.\\u201d \\u201cYou have no idea what you\\u2019re doing for us right now.\\u201d \\u201cThis really means a lot.\\u201d \\u201cThank you.\\u201d And I had to ask the question. [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I know what you thought. Some of you are like, \\u201cDon\\u2019t do it.\\u201d Oh, I did it. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here. Watch. So, I looked, and I said, \\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d And she was like, \\u201cNo, unfortunately. We\\u2019re not okay. We\\u2019re not.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been homeless now for four days.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you heard.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cBut, uh\\u2026\\u201d No, not\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience chuckles] I didn\\u2019t correct her \\u2019cause I\\u2019m not a dick. That\\u2019s why I didn\\u2019t correct her. [audience laughs] That\\u2019s what I mean, you guys. Even if you have good intentions nowadays, people can take what you\\u2019re saying or doing and twist it to make you look bad. There should be no consequences for being kind, for trying to help, for wanting to do the right thing, for caring. Unfortunately, we\\u2019re still consumed by this word called \\u201cliability\\u201d that sometimes we forget to be a little human, and that\\u2019s unfortunate. I\\u2019m not trying to get on a soapbox about this. I\\u2019m trying to let you know some things I\\u2019ve been dealing with, and I\\u2019m just here to report. [audience chuckles] The thing with me now is that after 27 years of being a comedian, every time I walk out the door, the light is officially on. In the sense that every time I leave my house, there is a slight chance I could make the news. For example, did Martin talk about how, uh, he fell off the stage earlier in the show?\\n[crowd] Yeah.\\nOkay. Okay, cool. Uh, for the home audience, Martin, he fell a while back. He talked about it. I know you didn\\u2019t see it, \\u2019cause your subscription only covers so much.\\nUm, yeah.\\n[audience laughs] You can watch the first half on Prime. I think it\\u2019s on Prime. Maybe you can just see it there then come back and check out the rest. So, long story short, we were doing a show in Phoenix, Arizona, and Martin accidentally fell off of a stage this high, and he broke his foot. Now, the incredible part about Martin is that he got up, and on adrenaline, ran around, got back up on stage, and performed. And then was taken to the hospital after he walked off stage. He is a professional. [audience cheers] Seriously, that is a pro. Much respect \\u2019cause if it would have been me\\u2026 [audience chuckles] If I would\\u2019ve fallen off stage, and the staff was like, \\u201cWhat about the fans?\\u201d \\u201cWell, bye, Felicia.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhat do we tell \\u2019em?\\u201d \\u201cRefund.\\u201d [audience laughs] But see, the difference is Martin had to tell you he fell for you to know he fell. And by the way, I saw the fall. I saw. He came out and just kind of tripped over a cord backstage, came through the curtain already, you know. And then, you know\\u2026 \\u201cMartiiin!\\u201d [imitates thud] Women in the front row were like, \\u201cHe fell for me.\\u201d [audience laughs] I\\u2019m glad you laughed. I said that last night and some guy was like, \\u201cAw.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cWhy \\u2018aww\\u2019?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s your friend.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cExactly. That\\u2019s why I make fun of him.\\u201d That is the mark of a true friendship, is being able to say real evil things about each other. [audience cheers] Because you know you don\\u2019t really mean it. Plus, you don\\u2019t think that if I would\\u2019ve fallen off the stage instead of Martin that he wouldn\\u2019t\\u2019ve had a joke? You better believe he would have had a joke. He would have told people, \\u201cI saw Fluffy bounce.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot to mention the fact that you know that\\u2019ll make the news. I fall off the stage tonight, there\\u2019ll be a van out in front in an hour. \\u201cWe\\u2019re standing here live in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, where authorities believe Fluffy lost control.\\u201d \\u201cLet\\u2019s go to Tom, who\\u2019s inside the venue who can fill us in with more.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, Jim, I\\u2019m standing here at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, inside the venue where apparently Fluffy took a spill.\\u201d \\u201cIt is still uncertain as to what happened here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cWe did have a chance to interview local authorities who had this to say.\\u201d \\u201cDamn!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt is still uncertain if there was any problems with the stage.\\u201d \\u201cWe did speak to security who had this to comment.\\u201d \\u201cI saw the whole damn thing. Okay?\\u201d \\u201cWhoo! Fluffy fell. He fell hard.\\u201d \\u201cI ain\\u2019t seen that many white people cry since a Taylor Swift concert.\\u201d \\u201cIt was bad. It was bad. And in Miami. Are you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cHe hurt more Cubans than Castro.\\u201d [audience laughs] And that\\u2019s how you get canceled. So, uh, that\\u2019s the point I\\u2019m trying to make here. I made the news recently. Uh, without giving too much away, there\\u2019s an episode of Family Feud coming out very soon that I\\u2019m gonna be on. Yeah.\\n[audience applauds]\\nIt is the celebrity edition, so it\\u2019s Fluffy and Fluffy\\u2019s family versus Fat Joe\\u2026 [audience gasps] \\u2026and his family. So yeah, it\\u2019s Fat Joe versus Fluffy because apparently, the producers have a great sense of humor. [audience laughs] Long story short, I flew in some family from the East Coast to be on the show. The show went over very well. You\\u2019ll find out who wins later. Here\\u2019s the deal. The next day, my sister, who was one of the people I flew in, she hadn\\u2019t been in California in forever, and she was like, \\u201cCan we go to Disneyland?\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cSure, let\\u2019s go.\\u201d So it was her and her husband Gordy, and I took them to Disney. And we get on a couple of rides, and just so we\\u2019re clear, that\\u2019s not what made the news. [audience chuckles] I said that last night, someone was like, \\u201c\\u2018Cause he fit.\\u201d No!\\n[audience laughs]\\nSome people. Right? Yeah. We get on the Cars ride at California Adventure, and halfway through the Cars ride, the car\\u2026 [imitates engine revving, brakes screeching] \\u2026stops on the track. And my sister looked at me. She goes, \\u201cIs this supposed to happen?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, the check cleared. We\\u2019re supposed to finish. This is, uh\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWe paid. It\\u2019s supposed to work. No, this\\u2026\\u201d It took the Disney people about 20 minutes to come get us and take us out of the car. So we\\u2019re sitting there, outside, in the sun for 20 minutes. I had no problem with that because I am mocha. I\\u2019m okay in the sun for 20 minutes. My sister, she\\u2019s twice as dark as me. She\\u2019s, like, freaking, you know, Apache. She\\u2019s\\u2026 You know. Freaking Azteca. [chanting] Just, you know\\u2026 Her husband, on the other hand, he\\u2019s from Minnesota. [audience laughs] He almost died.\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cOh, don\\u2019 cha know?\\u201d Yeah, so\\u2026 while we\\u2019re sitting there in the car, waiting for the Disney people to come take us out of the car, the people waiting in line realize that the ride has been shut down. And so from the ride, you can see the line. People see the car on the track, and then they see who\\u2019s in the car. [audience chuckles] And all of a sudden, cell phones start comin\\u2019 out. And by the time we left Disney, TMZ had already reported the story, and you can google this, okay? TMZ reported the story. Before we left the park, it said, \\u201cFluffy Stuck on LA Freeway at Disney.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I thought it was cute. I thought it was silly. I thought it was funny. I thought it was okay. Until I read the comments. [audience chuckles] Oh, some of you\\u2026 are dicks. [audience laughs] One lady wrote, \\u201cJust \\u2019cause you\\u2019re tall enough to ride doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re small enough to fit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nA guy wrote, \\u201cThe car got tired.\\u201d [audience laughs] Another guy wrote, \\u201cYou\\u2019re Mexican. Couldn\\u2019t you fix it?\\u201d [audience laughs] And that was Martin, yeah. So\\u2026 [audience laughs] [imitates rim shot] Anyway, so\\u2026 The time before that, we made world news. Some of you might remember this story. The guys and I were involved in an emergency landing situation. I had, uh, chartered a private jet because my last Netflix special, the money finally hit my account, and I, you know, freakin\\u2019\\u2026 I thought I was, y\\u2019know, ballin\\u2019, right? Nope. Turns out we were fallin\\u2019! Worst turbulence we have ever experienced in 27 years of being comedians. Uh, worst turbulence I ever felt, for sure. At one point, the jet did this.\\n[whooshes]\\n[audience chuckles] I did this.\\n[imitates thud]\\n[audience chuckles] The scariest part was watching my dogs leave the seat. Fortunately, we landed safely. We were okay. That\\u2019s not what made the news. What made the news is that, when we came in for the landing, the jet touched down, and then it skid off the runway by 200 yards, and we ended up in a field. A field. A field! Are you kidding me? As hard as I work\\u2026 [audience laughs] [audience applauds] \\u2026to break stereotypes. [audience laughs] A bunch of Mexicans ended up in a field. Yeah, that\\u2019s what happened.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat\\u2019s how TMZ reported it. \\u201cMexicans Found in Field.\\u201d [audience chuckles] In the movies, the pilots are always the first to know when there\\u2019s an issue. And in the movies, the pilots always have the courtesy of telling the passengers. They love to hear themselves talk. They get on the mic, \\u201cAll right. It\\u2019s your captain speaking here.\\u201d \\u201cI just want to let you know we\\u2019ll be experiencing rough air.\\u201d \\u201cIf you could just fasten your seatbelts, we\\u2019re gonna be A-okay. All right\\u2026\\u201d [murmurs] You know? If it gets bumpy, you know, [whooshing] [as captain, mumbling] \\u201cIt\\u2019s your captain speaking.\\u201d \\u201cSomebody just had a little Mexican food here, so we\\u2026 we\\u2019re feeling a little bumpy up here.\\u201d \\u201cWe just had some fast food.\\u201d \\u201cJust a reminder to keep your seat belts fastened.\\u201d \\u201cWe might be getting a bit\\u2026 There we go. Just a bit there.\\u201d [laughs] \\u201cAll right, I\\u2019ll be back with you in just a few seconds\\u2026\\u201d [mumbles indistinctly] If the plane\\u2019s going down, \\u201cBrace for impact!\\u201d \\u201cHold on tight! We\\u2019re comin\\u2019 in hot!\\u201d Our pilot\\u2026 nada.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOur pilot didn\\u2019t say anything until we came to, like, a complete stop. And then maybe like a minute later, the cockpit door opened up, and he stuck his head in, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou good?\\u201d [audience laughs] I was like, \\u201cMy chihuahua\\u2019s in a cup holder. I am not good.\\u201d It was a scary situation, you guys, but let me tell you, even though we were involved in an emergency landing and we thought we were gonna die, I\\u2019m grateful for the experience. Believe it or not. I\\u2019m grateful because it reminded me how valuable life is and how quickly things can change.\\n[audience applauds]\\nEvery now and then, we need a little reminder. We need to get shaken up a little to remind ourselves, \\u201cOh my God. This is special.\\u201d \\u201cThis is important. Enjoy it. Have fun.\\u201d The rest of the day after the landing, there was nothing anybody could tell me to ruin how good I felt to just be breathing and be alive. Nothing! [audience cheers and applauds] And so, that\\u2019s why I, uh\\u2026 I\\u2019m grateful for bad moments. And I think bad moments are actually a good thing because we need balance in life. You need to have bad experiences in order to truly appreciate good experiences. Not every day can be the same. [audience applauds] You need to have a way to ba\\u2013 Now, don\\u2019t get me wrong. Sometimes there\\u2019s too many bad days in a row. That shit sucks. And that\\u2019s actually what happened to me. After the near-death experience, I go home. I go home to find out that someone broke into my house. [audience gasps] Yeah. Yeah, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you kidding me?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I survived? To see this shit?\\u201d [audience laughs] The only reason why you haven\\u2019t heard about it until now is because the detective who\\u2019s working the case told me I\\u2019m not allowed to talk about it. In California.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah, if the guys that broke into my house are here tonight\\u2026 [scoffs] \\u2026bravo. [sarcastically] Bravo. That\\u2019s a flex and a half. No, they broke into my house, and of course, the number one question is, \\u201cWhat did they take from your house?\\u201d And what they took from me, honestly, it was my peace of mind. I didn\\u2019t feel safe in that house after. Uh, but if you must know, I did everything to prevent a break-in. I had, first of all, a good neighborhood. I had an alarm. I had two camera systems. I had a fence that surrounded the property. I thought I was good. Um, I got video footage of the entire robbery.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIn 4K. [audience chuckles] Oh, that shit is crisp. I saw the guys that broke in, but I could not identify them because they were wearing masks. All I can tell you about the two guys that broke into my house is that they were 20 years old. I know they were 20 because when they jumped the fence and hit the ground, no pain.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf that would\\u2019ve been a 35-year-old with messed-up sciatica, he\\u2019d have thought twice about that fence. So, they jumped the fence, went in the backyard, and they broke the window and got in through the kitchen. They trashed my house. Okay, every drawer, open. Every cabinet, open. Everything got pulled out onto the floor so they could sift. Uh\\u2026 Couches were flipped over, cushions were thrown down, and they pulled every single frame off the wall. And I asked the detective, I said, \\u201cHey, look. I understand the drawers, the cabinets, and even the couch thing.\\u201d \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the story with the frames on the wall?\\u201d \\u201cWhy did they take everything off the wall but didn\\u2019t take any frames?\\u201d \\u201cSome of that stuff was art.\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cMr. Iglesias, you have to understand something about these people that broke into your home.\\u201d \\u201cThey were not looking for photos or art.\\u201d \\u201cThey were actually looking for a safe.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d [as cop] \\u201cYes, sir. A safe.\\u201d \\u201cA lot of times, in these homes, people will put a hole in the wall, install a safe, and then they\\u2019ll hang a frame over the safe to disguise that their valuables are in there.\\u201d I said, \\u201cA safe?\\u201d\\n[audience chuckles]\\n[as cop] \\u201cSir, yes, a safe.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cBut I just got this money.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cDid they check the mattress?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as cop] \\u201cDon\\u2019t know.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s find out!\\u201d So, we walk into the master bedroom. I grab the edge of the bed, right? And I picked it up, and I was like, \\u201cAh, stupid!\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all here.\\u201d Oh my God. These guys had no idea they were robbing somebody more ghetto than them. [audience laughs] So, at the end of it, they only got a couple of little trinkets from the drawers. Um, and that\\u2019s pretty much it. They made a mess of the house. They didn\\u2019t get any of the money. I\\u2019ll tell you what they did get. They got my guns. [audience exclaims] Now\\u2026 I have never been open about the fact that I am, in fact, a registered gun owner.\\n[audience cheers]\\nRelax, Florida. [audience laughs] I\\u2019ve never been open about it because, quite frankly, it\\u2019s nobody\\u2019s business. Okay? However, it does pertain to the story that I\\u2019m about to share with you. Um, I am a recent gun owner. I became a gun owner in 2020, m\\u2019kay? Uh, yeah, when we were in the middle of\\u2026 [loudly] \\u2026it. [audience laughs] Every morning watching the news, we didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen, and it started to feel irresponsible, not preparing myself for a worst-case situation. Every morning watching the news, it felt like we were headed towards the Purge. [audience chuckles] Some of you are laughing, but think about this, the Purge would have taken less time. [audience chuckles] Yeah, the Purge. That\\u2019s how they should\\u2019ve woke us up, at least for entertainment purposes. [imitates alarm sounding] [feminine voice] \\u201cI\\u2019d like to thank you for your participation in the pandemic.\\u201d \\u201cThe local time is 7:45 a.m.\\u201d [moans seductively]\\n[audience laughs]\\nFear is why I decided to buy a gun. I was afraid, and I got no problem saying that. I was scared. We didn\\u2019t know what was gonna happen. Um, it\\u2019s only for protection. I don\\u2019t hunt. I don\\u2019t want to hunt. I don\\u2019t need to. I know where there\\u2019s three Chick-fil-As. [audience laughs] I\\u2019m good. I don\\u2019t go out on the weekends, you know? Pull! [imitates rifle firing] There\\u2019s no\\u2026 [quacking] I still own a Nintendo. I don\\u2019t need that shit. Fear is the only reason why I decided to buy a gun. So, I wound up at this sporting goods store right by my house. I walk in there, and this place is packed full of people that normally would not have been open to the idea of owning a gun, but they felt like me. They were scared, and rightfully so. I kept hearing the same conversation over and over and over. I kept hearing this\\u2026 \\u201cI would rather have a gun and not need it than need it and not have it.\\u201d [audience cheers] [audience applauds] And I don\\u2019t care where you\\u2019re from, that makes a lot of sense. And I was not about to let politics interfere with my personal safety. So, next thing you know\\u2026 [audience cheers] So, next thing you know, I got in line. I had to get a ticket with a number like when you\\u2019re at the DMV or meat market. [in Spanish] The butcher shop. The bodega. \\u201cNumber five!\\u201d [in English] I got in line. Forty-five minutes, I waited in line. And as soon as I get to the front, this guy comes to the counter, and he\\u2019s like\\u2026 [in Southern accent] \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, um\\u2026\\u201d By the way, I heard some of you chuckle, and just so we\\u2019re clear, I\\u2019m not saying that\\u2026 all people [sighs] \\u2026who sell guns\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u2026talk like that. [audience laughs] But his name was Jim. [audience laughs] So, Jim was like, \\u201cHow can I help you, son?\\u201d \\u201cWell, I\\u2019m here to see about purchasing my first firearm.\\u201d \\u201cWell, you\\u2019ve come to the right place. Know what you want?\\u201d \\u201cOr you need a hand?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019ve had some time to look at your selection, and I think I found something that\\u2019s gonna work for me.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. Show me what you got.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, right over here in the case.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cYeah, right here.\\u201d \\u201cThis one. The one right here, in the front.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. Not that one. This one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. This one. Not that one.\\u201d \\u201cThis one?\\u201d \\u201cNo. The one in front.\\u201d \\u201cWith the tag. The tag. Right here. The one that says two-two.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cUm, sir, did you just call that gun\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cYeah. What?\\u201d \\u201cJi\\u2026 Jim, right? Jim? Jim.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t look at me like I\\u2019m crazy, dude. I\\u2019m just reading the tag.\\u201d \\u201cIt says it right here. In the front. It says two-two.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou mean a .22?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, yeah. I guess. Two-two, .22, same thing.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, I hate to break it to you, but there\\u2019s a big difference between a tutu and a .22.\\u201d \\u201cBut hey, this is California, so whatever floats your boat, son.\\u201d \\u201cAll right?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cNow, is there any particular reason why you have selected a, uh\\u2026 a \\u2018tutu\\u2019?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as self] \\u201cWell, um, as impressive as your selection of guns here is, I recognize a lot of them from movies.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s a bit much for me.\\u201d \\u201cUm, I\\u2019m very simple.\\u201d \\u201cUm, this gun looks very manageable.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s small and, you know, it looks easy.\\u201d \\u201cPlus, it\\u2019s on sale.\\u201d \\u201cYou know what I mean? Come on, man. A gun\\u2019s a gun, right?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as Jim] \\u201cNot exactly.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIs this not a good choice?\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, you want my opinion, or you want to buy and be done with it?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNo, please tell me if I\\u2019m making a mistake.\\u201d \\u201cIs\\u2026 is a\\u2026 a .22 a good gun or a bad gun?\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, in my personal opinion, you\\u2019re better off tickling him, as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cAll you\\u2019re gonna do is aggravate the situation.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re just gonna piss him off is what I\\u2019m trying to tell you.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cWell, listen to my thought process.\\u201d \\u201cMy whole idea for the gun is, I\\u2019m gonna use the gun more so like as a deterrent.\\u201d \\u201cSo if somebody breaks into the house, they\\u2019re gonna see this big bald Mexican holding a gun, and then they\\u2019re gonna think twice and then rob my neighbors instead.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cSon, if somebody breaks into your house and they have a gun, they\\u2019re gonna know you\\u2019re holding a .22.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s gon\\u2019 happen.

Right?\\u201d \\u201cAnd the beating you\\u2019re gon\\u2019 get from a .22 is gonna hurt a hell of a lot more than the bullets out of a .22.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s for damn sure.\\u201d [audience applauds] \\u201cNow, listen, I don\\u2019t know you, but I think I know your situation.\\u201d \\u201cAnd correct me if I\\u2019m wrong.\\u201d \\u201cYou want to protect your home?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYour family?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYour valuables?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYes.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right, follow me.\\u201d \\u201cI think I got just what you need right here.\\u201d \\u201cM\\u2019kay?\\u201d \\u201cYou see this right here?

She\\u2019ll never find me here.\\u201d \\u201cSo, this bullet, when it comes out the chamber, it opens up.\\u201d \\u201cAnd when it hits, it\\u2019ll leave a hole about yay big.\\u201d And stupid me, I said this, I said, \\u201cPeople survive that?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as Jim] \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSurvive?\\u201d \\u201cSon, you don\\u2019t want \\u2019em to survive.\\u201d \\u201cYou want \\u2019em dead as fried chicken, as far as I\\u2019m concerned.\\u201d [audience applauds] I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want anybody to die.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want anybody to die?!\\u201d \\u201cYou guys hear that?\\u201d \\u201cYou hear that?

I felt that. I felt it.\\u201d Um\\u2026 \\u201cIf I\\u2019m cornered like that, and I have absolutely no choice, and my life is in danger, I promise you, Jim, I will step up, man, and I will shoot them right in the leg.\\u201d \\u201cI will.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cYou think you\\u2019re gonna hit the leg, Mr. First-Time Gun Owner?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHey, if I buy that bullet you\\u2019re trying to sell me, that covers that much, up close, I can hit a leg.\\u201d \\u201cTwo steps closer, I\\u2019ll shoot him in the huevos. I will, dude.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll hit a pelota. I will. No more babies, man.\\u201d [as Jim] \\u201cAll right. All right. You don\\u2019t gotta get graphic on me, now.\\u201d \\u201cSon, you know what\\u2019s gonna happen if you shoot someone in your home, in the leg, and they live?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cYeah. I know.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna sleep better, knowing I didn\\u2019t take a life and I was able to protect my home, my family, and my stuff.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s what\\u2019s gonna happen.\\u201d [as Jim] Ah. \\u201cClearly, you\\u2019re a Disney fan.\\u201d [audience laughs] [as Jim] \\u201cThat\\u2019s about the biggest fantasy I\\u2019ve ever heard, right there.\\u201d \\u201cSon, I would ask you if you knew, but clearly, you don\\u2019t, so I\\u2019m not gonna waste my time spinnin\\u2019 my wheels on this one.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m just gonna call it like it is.\\u201d \\u201cIf you shoot someone in your home and they live, they can come back and sue your ass.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. Now, here\\u2019s the kicker.\\u201d \\u201cThey\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s right. They\\u2019re gonna win.\\u201d \\u201cAnd not only are they gonna get everything they wanted to get when they first broke in, when it\\u2019s all said and done, you are gonna cut them a big fat check.\\u201d \\u201cNow, what do you got to say about that?\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat motherfucker\\u2019s gonna die!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering and clapping]\\nHe got excited. [as Jim] \\u201cNow, we\\u2019re talkin\\u2019!\\u201d I found out something that day. I found out that people that sell guns are a lot like people that sell used cars. They play on your emotions, and then they start to upsell you and make you buy things you don\\u2019t want or need. He knew I was scared because he kept saying it to me. [as Jim] \\u201cI know you\\u2019re scared.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re scared, and your fears. You\\u2019re worried. You\\u2019re scared.\\u201d Every time he\\u2019d say \\u201cscared,\\u201d something else appeared on the counter. [audience laughs] He sold me so well that when he was done \\u201cselling me,\\u201d I wound up with four rifles\\u2026 [audience laughs] \\u2026and four handguns and a case\\u2026 a case of spreader ammunition. [audience chuckles] I hear some of you clapping, and why? It\\u2019s excessive. I only have two hands. [audience laughs] See, I feel, again, even though my home was burglarized, I feel grateful because I wasn\\u2019t there and I had my dogs with me. I can\\u2019t replace my dogs. I can\\u2019t replace me. [audience cheering] Stuff is stuff. However, if I would have been home, I would have done whatever I needed to do. That\\u2019s the difference. In this situation, there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me, had the guns, had the ammo, glad they weren\\u2019t there, but if they were there, they would\\u2019ve done something about it. \\u2018Cause if I was in bed and I heard the\\u2026 [imitates crashing] \\u2026I would\\u2019ve jumped up. [grunting] I would\\u2019ve grabbed my gun. [imitates gun cocking] I would\\u2019ve ran out into the living room with no shirt on and one sock off.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI\\u2019d have confronted the person. \\u201cFreeze!\\u201d Knowing my luck\\u2026 [audience chuckles] [as burglar] \\u201cFluffy?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI said, freeze!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re funny. You\\u2019re funny, bro.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re funny.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cGet on the ground!\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cOh!\\u201d [as self] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make me shoot you.\\u201d [as burglar] \\u201cAh, hey!\\u201d [exclaims] \\u201cHey, Beto, get in here! Get in here! You\\u2019ll never guess whose house this is!\\u201d The other guy runs in. [as Beto] \\u201cOh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Oh, hey.\\u201d \\u201cI grew up watching you.\\u201d [audience laughs and cheers] Next thing you know, I\\u2019m autographing things they\\u2019re about to take. [audience chuckles] [mouthing inaudibly] [audience laughs] [continues mouthing] [audience laughs] So like I said, in this situation, I feel like there\\u2019s two kinds of people. One, people like me. Had the guns, had the ammunition. Glad they weren\\u2019t home, but if they would have been home, they would have done something about it. That\\u2019s one type of people. The other kind of people are the kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to\\u2026\\n[scattered cheering]\\nOh. Good. You\\u2019re here. [audience laughs] The kind of people who cannot wait for the opportunity to confront an intruder because you know you have way more guns and ammunition than they do, and you are prepared for war. [audience cheers] The kind of people who sit home at night in the living room, in the dark, holding their gun.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[imitates rifle cocking] They leave the front door unlocked to make it easier. [audience laughs] And people like that always have a friend either across the street or across town. \\u201cHow is everything over there on your side?\\u201d [imitating radio static] \\u201cIt\\u2019s all clear over here. How about you?\\u201d \\u201cYeah. Coast is clear. Ten-four. Out.\\u201d There. This situation, the break-in, left me traumatized. I couldn\\u2019t go back to living in the house because I didn\\u2019t feel safe. It\\u2019s just me and two chihuahuas. Yeah, that\\u2019s it. I\\u2019m no longer with my son\\u2019s mom, and my son lives with his mom. So, you know\\u2026 And by the way, I told my son Frankie what happened, about the break-in, and right away, right away, \\u201cOh, really? They\\u2019re lucky I wasn\\u2019t there.\\u201d [audience chuckles] I\\u2019m like, \\u201cC\\u00e1lmate, John Wick.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThey would\\u2019ve kidnapped you.\\u201d \\u201cI would\\u2019ve had to pay double to get you back.\\u201d I could not go back to living at the house. Again, it\\u2019s just me. So, I put the house up for sale. Uh, yeah, I just couldn\\u2019t. And it was a big beautiful home that you guys helped pay for. Thank you. [audience chuckles] It was nice. Real nice. Freaking four bathrooms. Four bathrooms. Yeah. One penis.\\n[audience laughs]\\nEven if I ran, I couldn\\u2019t, you know\\u2026 I put the house up for sale, and here\\u2019s the dilemma that I faced. I put it up for sale before I had a new place to live because I figured I\\u2019m on the road, I\\u2019m always in a tour bus, a plane, a hotel, always somewhere. I\\u2019m on the go. I was just trying to get ahead of it because when I first bought the house, it was sitting on the market for almost two years. So I thought I had time. What happened was it sold like that because I had two people bidding on the house at the same time and they kept driving up the price. And one of the people trying to buy the house, he wanted all of my furniture and so my agent for the house goes, \\u201cGabriel, this is crazy.\\u201d \\u201cThese two guys are bidding on your house, and they want to give you way more than what you\\u2019re asking.\\u201d \\u201cOne of them wants to give you an extra $100,000 for all of your furniture.\\u201d \\u201cI suggest you take it.\\u201d And so, I did. I sold the house with everything, except the mattress. Everything. The problem is I don\\u2019t have a house right now. I don\\u2019t have anywhere to live, so technically, I\\u2019m, um\\u2026\\n[audience laughs]\\nFuck it. I\\u2019m homeless. I don\\u2019t care. [audience cheers] I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019ll say it. I\\u2019m not gonna be \\u201cunhoused.\\u201d I\\u2019m homeless right now. They can\\u2019t cancel me. What are they gonna do? Take my house? I don\\u2019t have one. Ha! [audience laughs] So whatever. Mm. But no, at this point, at\\u2026 at 47 years of age, I don\\u2019t need more stuff. I\\u2019m happy that I do have stuff, but I don\\u2019t need it. What I want more than anything else now is better relationships. Better friendships, better people in my life, that\\u2019s what I want more than anything else. I announced in my last special at Dodger Stadium that I was no longer in a relationship. And I thought that was the best place to announce that because I\\u2019ve been very open about my life, my whole show is my life. People kept asking about her. So I thought that was the best place to announce that. You know what happens when you tell 50,000 people at a stadium that you\\u2019re single and then Netflix airs that around the world? I received thousands of \\u201capplications\\u201d for the Fluffy fulfillment center. Yes, I did. [chime dings] [Gabriel] That\\u2019s right, Netflix. Fluffy is hoein\\u2019 out. [audience chuckles] It was incredible. It was exciting. It was overwhelming, And it was terrifying because I didn\\u2019t know what they wanted. Um, well, I\\u2019m gonna tell you that since announcing that I was single, I\\u2019ve gone out on a few dates. And, uh, yeah. I don\\u2019t want to say how many, \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t want your judgment. [chuckles] \\u201cFluffy\\u2019s a whore.\\u201d [in English and Spanish] \\u201cHe\\u2019s nasty.\\u201d [in English] \\u201cHe\\u2019s like Santa with all his ho ho hos, yeah.\\u201d I still want to go out. I still want to have fun, I want to make connections, but unfortunately, I don\\u2019t trust people. I\\u2019m afraid. I can meet people really easy, but then I find out what they\\u2019re up to, and that sucks. Um, my heart is guarded now. Super guarded. There\\u2019s a wall and then a wall and then a wall and a wall and a wall. I\\u2019m like the only Mexican who likes walls.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo moving forward, I can tell you I don\\u2019t want to be in another relationship. I\\u2019m actually doing okay. I still want to go out, but I don\\u2019t want to be in a committed relationship. I\\u2026 I don\\u2019t. No.\\n[man boos]\\n[grunts] What do you mean, \\u201cBoo\\u201d? The fact that I\\u2019m being honest about that I don\\u2019t want to be in a relationship, I think there\\u2019s something to be said about that. I could easily lie. Meet someone, say that we\\u2019re boyfriend/girlfriend, and have a thing. But does it mean anything if your behavior doesn\\u2019t change? I\\u2019m being up front and honest. All I want\\u2026 All I want\\u2026 All I want, watch\\u2026 To the guy that booed me for saying I don\\u2019t want a relationship. Raise your hand so I can\\u2026 Okay, you\\u2019re famous, so\\u2026\\nTo you\\u2026 What is your name?\\n[man] Justin.\\nJustin?\\nDustin. Dustin. All right, Dustin. Sorry for\\u2026 \\u201cDustin!\\u201d Like, all right, \\u201cChill, bitch.\\u201d Yeah. Yeah, right? Freakin\\u2019 \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [Gabriel and audience laugh] All right, Dustin. Me not wanting to be in a traditional relationship is a honest thing because, uh, I can tell you, I don\\u2019t want to be in a situation where I\\u2019m obligated to participate in things that don\\u2019t make me feel like a good person. And at the age of 47, I\\u2019m tired of arguing, yelling, feeling guilted, feeling obligated, not smiling more. [audience cheers] I\\u2019m good, man. I\\u2026 You know\\u2026 But I still want to go out. So I just want to be up front and honest. All I need, Dustin, watch, is someone to eat with. [audience cheers] Someone to drink with. Someone to go to movies with. And someone to cuddle with. [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And they don\\u2019t even gotta be the same person.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll I\\u2019m saying is sometimes it takes a village. Okay? Dustin, I would love to tell a woman, \\u201cHey, would you like to go see a movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cYeah.\\u201d Then we go. After the movie\\u2019s over, I go, \\u201cWhat did you think?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cRight?\\u201d \\u201cWould you like to see another movie?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cSure. When?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNext week?\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cGood.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cLet\\u2019s stay in touch. See you next week.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna be so cool. You like rom-coms. I like rom-coms.\\u201d \\u201cYou like horror movies. I like horror.\\u201d \\u201cThis is gonna work. I like this. I need this. [grunts] Can\\u2019t wait.\\u201d So I say, \\u201cAll right, gotta go.\\u201d And she gets weird. [as woman] \\u201cWait, wait. Hold on. Hold on.\\u201d \\u201cYou gotta go? I thought this was going good.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s going great. We\\u2019ll do more next week. This is cool.\\u201d [as woman] \\u201cBut what\\u2019s the rush?\\u201d \\u201cWhere are you headed? Where you going?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cUh, I\\u2019m about to call the cuddler. Why?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as woman] \\u201cThe cuddler, what\\u2019s that?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI got that covered.\\u201d \\u201cOkay, movies, that\\u2019s your lane. Stay in it, okay?\\u201d \\u201cThis is us. We\\u2019re good. Solid. You\\u2019re the movie girl, okay?\\u201d Now, Dustin. I didn\\u2019t tell her. But I\\u2019m gonna tell you. When it comes to the department of cuddling, and this is so crazy because I\\u2019ve always been in a relationship and I could never be this open and honest, but now that I\\u2019m single, these are Fluffy\\u2019s flavors. [audience laughs] So, when it comes to the department of cuddling, this is what I want. I want a woman. A woman. A woman. With original factory settings. [audience laughs and cheers] [speaks indistinctly] This woman needs to be equal to, or greater than, in size. She needs to be a big girl. I prefer a big girl.\\nI want a big girl.\\n[audience cheers] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. This way, we both can agree on the temperature of the thermostat. [audience laughs and applauds] And only big girls know what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. [audience laughs] See, I\\u2019m a big boy, and as a big boy, I always run hot. Heat affects my mood. When I\\u2019m hot, Dustin, I become irritable, cranky, my anxiety goes through the roof. So for me to feel comfortable, I like to set the room to 68 degrees. Okay? [audience cheers] That\\u2019s right. And only a big girl can truly appreciate that. Skinny women, not so much. And let me tell you, I am tired of disappointing, skinny, cold women. [audience laughs] Skinny, cold women are mean. They\\u2019re mean. They don\\u2019t want it at freakin\\u2019 68 degrees. No, they want 72, 73, 74. [in Spanish] You\\u2019re killing me. No! [in English] But I can\\u2019t do that to them. I can\\u2019t put them in 68 degrees. They get snippy. They get evil. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cOh my God. What\\u2019s your problem?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold. It\\u2019s so cold.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cWell, fuckin\\u2019 eat something.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] \\u201cI\\u2019m tired of sweating.\\u201d But, yeah. Anyway, Dustin, I apologize. I wasn\\u2019t trying to turn this into a TED Talk. [audience chuckles] I don\\u2019t want you to think that I don\\u2019t believe in love because I do, and anyone who can pull it off, I commend you for it. I have met so many couples over the years. I\\u2019ve met 20-year couples, 30-year couples, 40-year couples, 50-year couples. I met one 55.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. Yeah. I call them unicorns. I\\u2019ll tell you the story. I was in Savannah, Georgia. And I had just finished filming the second Magic Mike movie. Now\\u2026 Yeah, I know. For those of you that don\\u2019t know, I was in Magic Mike. [audience cheers] Yes. I know. I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. [audience laughs] Magic Mike, not Tragic Mike. So, let\\u2019s remember that, okay? I was the only one who didn\\u2019t get naked. So, um\\u2026 Here\\u2019s the thing, after the movie, after we wrapped, my manager, Joe, tells me, he says, \\u201cDude, man.\\u201d \\u201cCongratulations on another project.\\u201d \\u201cI want to take you out for a steak dinner.\\u201d I said, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d So he takes me to this restaurant called Ruth\\u2019s Chris Steak House. Now, very popular chain around the country. We go there, we sit down, and here comes the server and the server\\u2019s real bubbly. \\u201cHey, guys. What\\u2019s going on? Are we celebrating anything today?\\u201d \\u201cActually, yes, we are.\\u201d \\u201cWell, guess what? You\\u2019re not the only ones.\\u201d \\u201cYou see that couple over there?\\u201d \\u201cThat couple is celebrating 55 years of marriage today.\\u201d And we\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d So, we look. [whoosh]\\n[audience chuckles]\\nI said, \\u201cHow come they\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience laughs] [as server] \\u201cI wondered the same thing, but the man made it a point to say 55 years.\\u201d \\u201cI thought that was pretty impressive.\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, it is.\\u201d So he leaves to go get us some sodas and some bread. And I tell my manager, I said, \\u201cHey, Joe, listen.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019mma go say hi to the couple real quick.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t get us kicked out.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI\\u2019m not gonna.\\u201d [as Joe] \\u201cDon\\u2019t make it like last time.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cIt\\u2019s not gonna be.\\u201d So I get up, and I push in my chair, and I make my way over to the couple. Now, I understand how important this night is for them. I know exactly how long it took to get to that point, and I am not trying to mess that up. But I have questions. [audience chuckles] And these two people are clearly professionals in that department. So I approached the table as tactfully as I could. And I said, \\u201cPardon the interruption.\\u201d \\u201cIt has come to my attention that we are celebrating 55 years of marriage.\\u201d And the man was so happy that someone acknowledged that. He was just thrilled. He\\u2019s like\\u2026 [breathing excitedly] [as older man] \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, son.\\u201d \\u201cFifty-five years ago today, this lovely lady sittin\\u2019 next to me right here said I do, and we\\u2019ve been together ever since.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cThat is beautiful.\\u201d \\u201cMay I ask you a question?\\u201d [as man] \\u201cAbsolutely.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cHow come you\\u2019re not talking?\\u201d [audience chuckles] [laughs as older man] \\u201cHe wants to know how come we\\u2019re\\u2026 Laugh, goddammit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cSon, when you\\u2019ve been together as long as the two of us have, you might\\u2019ve seen a thing or two.\\u201d Uh, uh\\u2026 \\u201cWe have children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren.\\u201d \\u201cWe have traveled this great big world of ours many times over.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re both retired military.\\u201d \\u201cWe have seen the best in people.\\u201d \\u201cAnd, unfortunately, when you\\u2019re around and alive as long as the two of us have been, uh, you\\u2019ve unfortunately seen the worst in people as well.\\u201d \\u201cWe have had just about every type of conversation there is to have. [audience chuckles] At least twice. [audience laughs] And after 55 years of marriage, well, hell, we\\u2019re just trying to enjoy each other\\u2019s company, even if it\\u2019s in silence.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve had every type of conversation there is to have?\\u201d And I guess I triggered him, because he was like, \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cLook at me!\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been in combat.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can faze me.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can surprise me anymore.\\u201d\\n[as self] \\u201cYou don\\u2019t say.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs] So, I took a step towards them, I grab my shirt, and I flash them. [audience laughs] And then I walked away. And you know what happened next? They started talking! [audience laughs and cheers] I gave that couple the greatest gift they will never ever acknowledge. Something new, something spontaneous, something outrageous, something neither one of them had ever seen before. I gave them a new story. I promise you, every year moving forward, all they\\u2019re gonna talk about is what happened at 55. [as older man] \\u201cRemember, honey. Remember when that Samoan flashed us?\\u201d [audience laughs] Right. \\u2018Cause I\\u2019m a giver. I remember many, many years ago, before there was a venue like this to perform in, the only place around here for comedians to do shows was at a comedy club right outside these doors that was part of the original layout of the casino. [audience cheers] It was a club called The Improv. There\\u2019s a chain all over. [audience cheers] And, you know, many, many years ago, before all of this, that\\u2019s where Martin and myself, my buddy Alfred, we\\u2019d go do shows at the\\u2026 at the club. And the first time we got a chance to perform there, I didn\\u2019t really have a name. I wasn\\u2019t really established yet. And I want to take this moment to acknowledge and thank one person who was super, super helpful in that, a man by the name of DJ Laz.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat\\u2019s right, people. The Pimp with the Limp. Oh, yeah, Pap\\u00e1. Yeah. \\u201cIt\\u2019s your boy, DJ Laz.\\u201d I love him, man. He\\u2019s great. He\\u2019s awesome. But yeah, he walks in circles. He does. He walks in circles. Nice guy. DJ Laz was one of the first people to allow me to be on morning radio with him, and he helped promote my shows. Not only would he allow me to go on his show and promote my shows, he would come to my shows, and he would bring people, and he\\u2019d watch and he\\u2019d sit and hang out and laugh. The man has a million things he can do in Miami, but he\\u2019d come watch my show. And then the next day, \\u201cPap\\u00e1, come on the radio with me.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna talk about your show.\\u201d And he would help me sell out these shows year after year after year. So, Laz, I know you\\u2019re watching, Pap\\u00e1. Thank you. This is part of you, Pap\\u00e1. Muchas gracias. Thank you. Thank you. But that was many years down the line. In the beginning, the first time I performed at that comedy club, right outside these doors, that\\u2019s no longer there\\u2026 Um, I\\u2019m talking to the marketing person. Now, keep in mind, this is so long ago, there was no social media. There was no TikTok, no freaking Twitter, no Facebook, none of that. The only way you could promote yourself back then was, you had to get on morning radio, morning news, have somebody do a write-up on you in the newspaper. Remember those? Yeah. And then, of course, word-of-mouth, which is always the best. Uh, they had posters at the comedy club. And so, the marketing guy goes, \\u201cGabriel.\\u201d \\u201cHelp me help you help us.\\u201d \\u201cWe want to sell tickets. How do you want to be promoted?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWell\\u2026\\u201d Keep in mind, long time ago. I said, \\u201cUm, this is how I want you to promote my show.\\u201d \\u201cPlease use a photo.\\u201d \\u201cUnder the photo, put my name, Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t have the nickname Fluffy yet. That\\u2019s how long ago this was. I said, \\u201cUnderneath that, please put, \\u2018As seen on Comedy Central.'\\u201d Because at the time, that was the only television credit I had. So the marketing guy goes, \\u201cWell, I was thinking, what about, \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and his amigos\\u2019?\\u201d [audience chuckles] \\u201c\\u2018Amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWhy \\u2018amigos\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cBecause I have other Mexicans with me?\\u201d And he looked at me and said, \\u201cGood. You get it.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like that. What about \\u2018Gabriel Iglesias and friends\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWell, we want to put a couple of buzzwords out there to let the community know what type of show it is.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat type of show is it?\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cIt\\u2019s a special show.\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel special.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cGabriel, hear me out. What about like a taco Tuesday?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cI don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d [as guy] \\u201cOkay, what about salsa night?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cSalsa night?\\u201d \\u201cWait, like dancing or chips and guac?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cEither one, I don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d I could not believe I was having this conversation, and I wanted to get upset. I wanted to go off on this guy for trying to make me feel like less of a person, right? But I didn\\u2019t, because I knew that if I went off on them, I would have been seen as difficult. I would have been seen as a problem, and I would not have been given another opportunity to come back. When people ask me, \\u201cWhat do you credit for your success?\\u201d Of course, talent, showing up, doing what you gotta do. But one word that gets left out a lot is the word \\u201csacrifice.\\u201d I had to sacrifice something that day, and a lot of people think they know what sacrifice means but honestly, until you have to make one, I don\\u2019t think you do. I had to sacrifice my pride because as much as I wanted to go off on this guy, I knew that if I did, I\\u2019d be shooting myself in the foot. I knew that if they could see what I could do on that stage, they\\u2019d have to bring me back, and they\\u2019d have to treat me different.\\n[audience cheers]\\nSo as much as it hurt, as much as it sucked, I allowed that stupid taco Tuesday to happen. So, for me, I was very upset. I was wondering, is this something that happens to all new comedians, or was I being singled out? It was killing me. I needed to know. I couldn\\u2019t just take out my phone and google it because that wasn\\u2019t an option all those years back. So what I had to do was I had to go to the front door of the club where they had a bin, and the bin had flyers in it. So I grabbed the flyer, and I looked at it. And the flyer had the list of upcoming comedy shows. And I was so upset when I saw it because all it was, was pictures, names, and television credits. No silly names, no theme nights, no \\u201cspicy this\\u201d or \\u201ccrazy that.\\u201d Just comedy. So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this stupid taco Tuesday thing to me?\\u201d So I said, \\u201cLet me try to find another comedian who\\u2019s a little bit more in my vein.\\u201d If you know what I mean. The only other comedian I could find was a man by the name of George Lopez.\\n[audience cheers]\\nWith George\\u2019s promo, however, it was just a picture, name, and underneath that, a television credit that said, \\u201cAs seen on ABC.\\u201d That\\u2019s it. It didn\\u2019t say, \\u201cLikes to ride a donkey, George Lopez,\\u201d \\u201cEats a burrito with both hands, George Lopez.\\u201d \\u201cAy, ay, ay. I just jumped the wall. It\\u2019s George Lopez.\\u201d No! So I said, \\u201cWhy are they doing this to me?\\u201d So then I said, \\u201cAll right, all right.\\u201d \\u201cLet me see how they promote the Black comedians.\\u201d And with the Black comedians, it was the same thing. Picture, name, television credit, and that\\u2019s it. Unless it was a show that had multiple Black comedians on it because if the comedy club had a show with three or more Black comics on it, they would put a catchy name to it. They would call the show \\u201cUrban Night\\u201d or \\u201cApollo Night\\u201d or \\u201cDef Jam Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBET Comedy Night,\\u201d \\u201cBlack-ish Comedy Night.\\u201d But that\\u2019s as far as they would go. They wouldn\\u2019t go to the next level like they would for me. Oh, yeah. There was no \\u201cMargarita Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTaco Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWetback Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTortilla Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFiesta Friday,\\u201d or \\u201cS\\u00e1bado Gigante\\u201d! No. That would never happen to Black people. Are you kidding me? You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMalt Liquor Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTupac Tuesday,\\u201d or \\u201cWatermelon Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cThong, Th-Thong, Thong Thursday,\\u201d or \\u201cFried Chicken Friday\\u201d or \\u201cSookie-Sookie Saturday\\u201d or \\u201cSlap-a-Ho Sunday\\u201d!\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nAnd that most definitely will not happen to white people. [audience chuckling] [scattered cheers] [speaks inaudibly] [cheering grows louder] Oh, I\\u2019mma do the joke. And you know why you can laugh and enjoy and not feel threatened by what I\\u2019m about to say? Because, like what I said earlier tonight, I am here to entertain, I am not here to offend. I\\u2019m here to have fun with everybody, starting with me. Plus, it\\u2019ll never happen. You\\u2019ll never see a \\u201cMonster Truck Monday\\u201d or \\u201cTrailer Park Tuesday\\u201d or \\u201cWhite Trash Wednesday\\u201d or \\u201cTake Your Sister Out Thursday.\\u201d [audience laughs] [in Southern accent] \\u201cOh, hell no, Fluffy! You done crossed the line now!\\u201d \\u201cMy name is Dustin, and I don\\u2019t play that shit.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m from Davie, goddammit.\\u201d [audience cheers] Next time, stay quiet. [audience laughs] So\\u2026 I was talking to Martin backstage before I came out, and he goes, \\u201cAre you gonna share the story about the theme nights thing that happened at The Improv here, and y\\u2019know?\\u201d I go, \\u201cWell, y\\u2019know, I think I should, Martin.\\u201d \\u201cI think I should tell the story about, y\\u2019know, the theme nights.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cGabe, can I tell you something about that theme nights bit?\\u201d I go, \\u201cTell me, Martin.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cDo you realize that in all the years I have heard you tell this story about what happened at that club, do you understand that you\\u2019ve never once finished the week?\\u201d [audience chuckles] I said, \\u201cMartin, you know why that is, right?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s the rule of comedy.\\u201d \\u201cYou always want to end on the biggest laugh.\\u201d \\u201cThursday gets the biggest laugh, which is why I stopped at Thursday.\\u201d And Martin goes, \\u201cI know, I know, I know.\\u201d \\u201cBut you\\u2019re robbing white people of their week.\\u201d [audience laughs] I never looked at it that way. \\u201cFox News Friday.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cStorm the Capitol Saturday.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cSay You\\u2019re Sorry Sunday\\u201d! [audience cheers] Are we still havin\\u2019 a good time? [audience cheers] Are we still having fun? [cheering grows louder] That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m talkin\\u2019 about. People laughing, not getting upset, not getting offended, not freakin\\u2019 making a stink. And let me tell you right now, for the five people who have never heard of me before, this\\u2026 is for you. [scattered cheers] I get pulled over one night, two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-through. [audience cheering knowingly] I made a left turn instead of making a right turn, but I wasn\\u2019t paying attention, \\u2019cause I had a box, right? I was like, \\u201cOh, you\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d [chuckles enthusiastically] [exclaims, chuckles] \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna get it.\\u201d I make a wrong turn all of a sudden. [imitates siren] [groans] [imitates vehicle approaching] [grunts sadly] \\u201cLater.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[gibbers indistinctly] The officer is taking forever. I said, \\u201cForget this.\\u201d I grab the box of donuts. I put it on my lap. I flipped it open. I was like\\u2026 [inhales sharply] Mm! [chuckles] Ah! [exclaims wildly] And just as I was about to tear it up, the officer gets to the window, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou know why I stopped you?\\u201d It was too easy. I picked up the box, and I said\\u2026 [with audience] \\u201c\\u2018Cause you can smell it!\\u201d [audience cheering] [crowd chanting] Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! [audience continues cheering] [chime dings] [Gabriel] You\\u2019re probably wondering, why did we pause the special again? Well, I just want to let you guys know most comedians would\\u2019ve already said, \\u201cThank you, good night,\\u201d gone home, cashed their Netflix checks, and hope they get another phone call. \\u201cPlease call me, Netflix.\\u201d [inhales] But this guy is not most comedians. That\\u2019s what happens when you hire a Mexican. We love overtime. [audience cheering] Thank you for still wanting to hear a joke that\\u2019s over 20 years old. [audience cheers] I grew up watching you too. [audience laughs] Got chills when I\\u2026 [in Spanish] Look, look. [audience laughs] [in English] That was beautiful. I love you too, and that\\u2026 Seriously, you guys, thank you for that. Thank you. [audience cheers] Thank you. There are fans, and then there\\u2019s what you just did right now. [audience cheering] I don\\u2019t know any other comedian that gets this type of love and loyalty. Thank you so much. I\\u2019m not getting off the stage yet \\u2019cause I still got more to go, but I want to say thank you for that. [audience cheers] Thank you. [sighs dramatically]\\n[audience cheering]\\n[Gabriel] Whoo! So when I started doing stand-up in 1997, the only place that would allow me to go up on stage and do what I do were bars. Dive bars, rough bars. Uh, Martin and I, that\\u2019s where we met, many, many years ago. We\\u2019re performing at this bar in Montebello, California, and, uh, you had to fight with the crowd. You had to fight because there was noise. There were TVs on. People were drinking, smoking\\u2026 People were doing everything in there but paying attention. So you had to come out quick, trying to get them to laugh. And one night, this comedian pulls me aside, and he goes, \\u201cHey, kid.\\u201d And when he called me kid, I got upset. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI could drink.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was 20, 21 years old, and, you know, even though I thought I was grown, I wasn\\u2019t. I wasn\\u2019t grown. Uh, I got upset that he pulled me aside. He goes, \\u201cCan I give you some advice?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWho does this guy think he is? I\\u2019m funnier than him.\\u201d That\\u2019s what I thought because at the age of 21, I was a punk. I really was. And so, I don\\u2019t know what got into me where I said, \\u201cSure, I\\u2019ll hear you out.\\u201d And I just stood there, and he said, \\u201cListen.\\u201d \\u201cUm, you\\u2019re really likeable on stage, and that\\u2019s rare.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna give you a bit of advice.\\u201d \\u201cIf you cut all the cussing out of your show and start taking the filthy material out, I think you\\u2019re gonna have a long career ahead of you.\\u201d And I know I said \\u201ctake the cussing out\\u201d and I\\u2026 I said the F-word twice tonight. [audience chuckles] Technically, no, three times. I said it three times. Um, but I\\u2019m mindful of it. I\\u2019m keeping count. It\\u2019s not every other word. Plus, we\\u2019re in a casino. [audience cheers] Okay. No one loses their ass and says, \\u201cAw, shucks.\\u201d No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI heard some of you cussing before. \\u201cWhen the fuck is this gonna start?\\u201d Yeah, I heard you. I heard you. [in Spanish] I\\u2019m fat, not deaf. [in English] I heard you, goddammit. So anyway, he gives me this advice. Cut the cussing out of your show, take out the filthy material. And I don\\u2019t know why I listen, but I did, and he was absolutely right. All of a sudden, I started getting opportunities left and right. I started getting booked at colleges, high schools, churches, fairs. And then the big one, casinos. [audience cheers] [cheering fades] Back in the day, you had to be squeaky-clean to perform at a casino. Uh, but that\\u2019s not the case anymore. If you can sell tickets, it doesn\\u2019t matter what you do, they want to book you. But back in the day, there was only a few people who could pull it off. I was fortunate to be one of those people. So I remember, I got booked to perform at a casino called Morongo in Southern California, and I\\u2019m backstage with the booker, the lady that hired me for the function, and she goes, \\u201cSo, no cussing, right?\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo. No cussing.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cNo filthy material?\\u201d [as self] \\u201cNo filthy material.\\u201d [as booker] \\u201cGood luck.\\u201d And it was just me. I didn\\u2019t have openers. It was just me. It was a voice-over on the frickin\\u2019 speaker, right? \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome comedian, funny man Gabriel Iglesias.\\u201d And then I just\\u2026 I walked out there, right? I offended the entire audience\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026in five seconds. And I did it without cussing. Frickin\\u2019 22-year-old kid goes up on stage, looks at the crowd and says, \\u201cHey, everybody! Is this a regular casino, or is this an Indian casino?\\u201d [audience groans and laughs] You see how you all know?\\n[audience laughs]\\nI didn\\u2019t know. I didn\\u2019t know because I didn\\u2019t have TikTok to teach me. [audience chuckles] What I did have was a life experience that I\\u2019ll never forget. As soon as I said that, the entire front row, which comprised of the tribal members from the casino, they all stood up, and one of them called me out in front of the entire audience. \\u201cHey! Hey! You don\\u2019t say that anymore!\\u201d \\u201cThe proper term is Native American.\\u201d \\u201cPlease show respect.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOh my God. I\\u2019m so sorry. I didn\\u2019t know.\\u201d And I felt horrible, and I was so embarrassed. Fortunately, I had a second show at ten o\\u2019clock. Ten o\\u2019clock hits. I take the stage. I didn\\u2019t need to be told a thousand times that I messed up. That one time of me getting shamed in front of the entire audience was all I needed. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m a firm believer in shaming. [audience laughs] I think shaming is good. Shaming is good as long as you shame with purpose. If you\\u2019re about to teach someone a valuable lesson, I say go for it because it worked for me. I got shamed one time. Second show, ten o\\u2019clock. I took the stage. Ooh, it was different. I was like, \\u201cBefore I get started, ladies and gentlemen, I\\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Native Americans who are here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cThank you for this opportunity to perform in your casino.\\u201d \\u201cI hope you enjoy the performance.\\u201d [audience cheers and laughs] I thought I was good. All of a sudden, another tribal member in the back jumped up. And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cHey, drop the \\u2018American\\u2019! Just say \\u2018Native\\u2019!\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[as self] \\u201c\\u2018Kay!\\u201d [audience laughs] That stayed with me. That was powerful. That was scary. Next time I did a casino, first thing I said was, \\u201cI would like to acknowledge all of the Natives who are here tonight,\\u201d and then someone yelled out, \\u201cWe\\u2019re Indigenous!\\u201d Fuck me! That\\u2019s four. [audience laughs and cheers] [chime dings] With time, I got a chance to perform all across the United States, and then I get my first-ever show in Canada. Ironically enough, at a casino. [audience laughs] It\\u2019s a casino we still perform at called Caesars in the city of Windsor, Ontario, right across the water from Detroit, Michigan. [audience cheers] I come to find out the hard way that in Canada, it is a completely different term for describing the\\u2026 people\\u2026 [audience chuckles] \\u2026originally from that land. The proper term in Canada is actually \\u201cFirst Nation.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t know that. I was so nervous being in Canada, I said, \\u201cNative American.\\u201d [audience laughs] Like, \\u201cHello?\\u201d I\\u2019m not even in America, right? Frickin\\u2019 stupid, right? Pendejo, I know. [audience laughs] Fortunately, someone pulled me to the side, and they told me what was up. I was lucky that I had a second show. Ten o\\u2019clock, I take the stage, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cBefore I begin, I would like to acknowledge all of the First Nation people who are here tonight.\\u201d Then some guy yells out, \\u201cCall us Indians!\\u201d [audience laughs] This guy in the front row was like\\u2026 [in Indian accent] \\u201cThey\\u2019re not Indian.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n[in Indian accent] \\u201cThey are not Indian!\\u201d [as self] Canada has always been an adventure. There was one show that we did at the same casino. Anytime now, we perform outside of the United States, even if it\\u2019s next door in Canada or Mexico, Martin\\u2019s first question to the audience is, \\u201cDo we have any Americans in the house tonight?\\u201d Because no matter where we perform in the world, there\\u2019s always a handful. So that night, Martin takes the stage, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans here tonight?\\u201d Not knowing that earlier in the day, at that same casino, in the grand ballroom, there was a\\u2026 a end-of-year holiday party from an American company from right across the water in Detroit. And they were having this end-of-year celebration, and they were there, pre-gaming since noon. [audience chuckles] Partying it up. And I guess the\\u2026 the party planner for the event thought it would be an amazing idea to end their party with laughter. So this person bought all of the tickets to my show that night and gave them to that company. Well, seven o\\u2019clock rolls around, and everybody stumbles in, takes their seats, and then Martin walks out, and he asked the question, \\u201cDo we have any Americans?\\u201d And instead of getting a \\u201cYay,\\u201d \\u201cWhoo,\\u201d \\u201cRight here,\\u201d he got\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] They were so drunk, they started chanting. \\u201cUSA! USA! USA! USA!\\u201d I\\u2019m in the dressing room, hearing this. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy are we here?\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cWe could have done this in Detroit.\\u201d You know? I had to fill out paperwork. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThis is not cool.\\u201d So during intermission, Martin comes backstage and he tells me, \\u201cBro, I don\\u2019t know if you heard\\u2026\\u201d [as self] \\u201cOh, I heard.\\u201d [as Martin] \\u201cMight wanna mention it.\\u201d I go, \\u201cOh, I will.\\u201d So at some point during my performance, I told the audience, \\u201cSo, a little bird told me there might be a couple of Americans here tonight.\\u201d \\u201cIs that true?\\u201d Sure enough\\u2026 [imitates crowd roaring] And they started doing it again. [chanting] \\u201cUSA! USA! USA!\\u201d Then it got quiet, and you could hear, \\u201c\\u2018Murica.\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cLadies and gentlemen, do you understand what just happened?\\u201d \\u201cWe just made history.\\u201d And people in the front row, they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWhat are you talking about, history?\\u201d I said, \\u201cWe just made history.\\u201d \\u201cWho would have ever thought you\\u2019d see the day where thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of Americans would cross a border\\u2026\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\n\\u2026to see a Mexican?\\u201d\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you for 27 years of supporting this Mexican.\\n[in Spanish] Miami, I love you so much.

Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\\u2013 There\\u2019s no value to your doing that at all.\\n\\u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\\u201d\\nI live\\u2013 I live in New York. I always\\u2013 Like, there\\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\\u2019s always walking her dog. She\\u2019s always just\\u2013 she\\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\\u2013 The two of them, it\\u2019s really\\u2013 The dog\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\\u2013 And she\\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\\u201910\\u201d, But now it\\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \\u201cyecch, no thank you. \\u201cI do not want those. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \\u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\\u2019s no\\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \\u201cgood morning, gladys,\\u201d She\\u2019d be like, \\u201cgood,\\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \\u201c\\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n\\u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\\u201d\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\\u2019s a weird moment, too, \\u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \\u201cyeah, he\\u2019s dead,\\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \\u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \\u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \\u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \\u201cwhy did he die, da\\u2013\\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\\u2019s the reason. That\\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\\u2019s why he\\u2019s dead. He didn\\u2019t know his name, and he didn\\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\\u2019t know which one. I don\\u2019t care. I don\\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\\u2019t. They don\\u2019t care, and we don\\u2019t care. There\\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \\u201cok, everybody. \\u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\\u2013you know what?\\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\\u201d And we would all be like, \\u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\\u201d Anyway, so we\\u2019re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he\\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\\u2019s going\\u2013 They\\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \\u201cbaa,\\u201d but they\\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\\u2019re like\\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\\u2019t go\\u2013 They go\\u2013 My daughter\\u2019s like, \\u201cwhat is he saying?\\u201d I don\\u2019t know! \\u201cI\\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\\u201d\\n\\u201cThe Food Chain\\u201d\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\\u2019m glad I\\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\\u2019re in the food chain. You\\u2019re in the food\\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\\u2019s how all life ends, is\\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \\u201cI love you. Bye.\\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \\u201cbeh,\\u201d and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cfine,\\u201d And it\\u2019s just, \\u201cwhy?\\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\\u2019t get it! Then you\\u2019re walking to work like, \\u201cwhy do I even bother? \\u201cshit! Goddamn it! \\u201cthere\\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\\u201d You think that sharks\\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\\u2019d be bummed \\u2019cause I don\\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \\u201chey, nobody has any idea what\\u2019s down here,\\u201d And we\\u2019re all up here like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s totally a shark right there.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\\u2013 \\u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\\u2019s why animals just\\u2013 They go, \\u201clet\\u2019s do this together, man. \\u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\\u201d That\\u2019s why they do it like that. \\u201cfuck it. I\\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\\u201d \\u201cgrownups ain\\u2019t worth the meat.\\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n\\u201cCourtyard Confrontation\\u201d\\nI live in New York city, and it\\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\\u2019t. Didn\\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\\u2019m not used to it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s nice. There\\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\\u2019t get a fountain made without\\u2013 \\u201ccan you make me a fountain?\\u201d \\u201cyes, I\\u2019ll get started right away! \\u201cYes! Yes! It\\u2019s finished!\\u201d And it\\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \\u201cjust piss on me forever!\\u201d Anyway, there\\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\\u2026 And so I\\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\\u2019s looking at me like, \\u201c\\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \\u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\\u201d And I\\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \\u201c\\u201d And then I see him go, \\u201cno. That\\u2019s not gonna do at all,\\u201d And he comes over to me, \\u201c\\u201d and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cNum num num!\\u201d I\\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \\u201crrgh!\\u201d So he comes over, says, \\u201cexcuse me, \\u201cdo you live in this building?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cno,\\u201d \\u2019cause why not start there? I said, \\u201cno.\\u201d He goes, \\u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cI just need to rest. I\\u2019m having a hard time.\\u201d He says, \\u201cthis is private property,\\u201d And I said, \\u201cwell, I don\\u2019t really believe in that.\\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \\u201cwell, if you don\\u2019t leave, I\\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\\u201d I was like, \\u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\\u201d So he\\u2019s\\u2013\\u201cno,\\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \\u201cno. That guy lives here. It\\u2019s OK,\\u201d And the look on his face\\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\\u2013 It was just so\\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\\u2019s feelings. That\\u2019s how excited I was.\\n\\u201cGetting What \\u2018Old\\u2019 Is\\u201d\\nI\\u2019m 45 now, So I\\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\\u2019t know which one. I won\\u2019t know till it\\u2019s over where this was. I don\\u2019t know how long I\\u2019m gonna live. I don\\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s too bad.\\u201d If I die five years from now, they\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cwell, all right,\\u201d like it\\u2019s not even\\u2013 It\\u2019s\\u2013 Like, as soon as you\\u2019re 50, you\\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\\u2019re in the news, and it\\u2019s always some old guy, \\u201cI met Napoleon.\\u201d No, you didn\\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\\u2019m like, \\u201cwow, this seems early for this.\\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\\u2019ll realize, \\u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\\u2019s just like, \\u201cJust\\u2013 \\u201d My asshole\\u2013 My asshole\\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \\u201crats.\\u201d That\\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\\u2019m\\u2013 OK. Say I\\u2019m sitting down. If I\\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\\u2013ha ha ha!\\u2013 I love sitting so much\\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\\u2013 At my age, if I\\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \\u201cwhat? Why do I\\u2013 no. Why, though?\\u201d \\u201cYour car is being towed right now!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\\u2019s\\u2013 I accept that.\\u201d \\u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \\u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\\u201d Like, let\\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \\u201c\\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \\u201c\\u201d like I\\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \\u201cshit.\\u201d\\n\\u201cPutting On Socks\\u201d\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\\u2013 Here\\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\\u2019t even know how I do it. I\\u2019m sitting here. I don\\u2019t know how I do that. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause you have to\\u2013 It\\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\\u2013 I\\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \\u201cbeep, beep, beep!\\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \\u201cOK. That\\u2019s hard.\\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n\\u201cIf You\\u2019re Older You\\u2019re Smarter\\u201d\\nI don\\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re right. It means that even if they\\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\\u2019ve been there longer. If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\\u2019s the interesting thing. There\\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\\u2019t clap. Why? \\u2019cause they\\u2019re smart. They\\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have to clap. I don\\u2019t have to do anything.\\u201d They\\u2019re not doing it, and they\\u2019re right. You know why? \\u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m asking. How do you know what\\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\\u2019s every time. \\u201cWhoo! Whoo!\\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\\u2019re not the only people here. That\\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\\u2013 \\u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\\u2019t have it! I don\\u2019t have it!\\u201d If you\\u2019re older, you\\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \\u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\\u2019s seen more. He\\u2019s seen history. He\\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \\u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \\u201cthe president\\u2019s kind of disappointing.\\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n\\u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\\u201d\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \\u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \\u201chey, I\\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\\u201d \\u201cso where do I\\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\\u2019d like to make one of those \\u201cit gets better\\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \\u201clisten, man. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s tough right now. \\u201cYou\\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \\u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \\u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \\u201cbut it gets better because you\\u2019ll all grow up, \\u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \\u201cand they don\\u2019t. \\u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \\u201cand you\\u2019re gonna be there. \\u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \\u201cYou\\u2019re gonna be\\u2013 \\u201cyou\\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \\u201cbefore she hits the ground. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna be so great. \\u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \\u201cto match your looks, but it\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gonna happen. \\u201cWhen real shit matters, you\\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\\u201d It\\u2019s just time. That\\u2019s all it takes. There\\u2019s a formula to this. It\\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n\\u201cEverybody Has Their Time\\u201d\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \\u201cthere\\u2019s someone for everyone.\\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \\u2019cause it\\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\\u2019s all that happens, \\u201caww,\\u201d and if you\\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \\u201cAww.\\u201d Well, go fuck one. \\u201cNah.\\u201d I didn\\u2019t think so. That\\u2019s the one way we\\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \\u201cyeah. No. You should. I\\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\\u201d\\n\\u201cDating Takes Courage\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\\u2013 It\\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \\u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \\u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\\u2019t do this!\\u201d But he walked up and said, \\u201chi. Yes,\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201c\\u201d \\u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \\u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\\u201d Sometimes she\\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\\u2019t know how they\\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\\u2019s the whole thing. That\\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \\u201cdude, I can\\u2019t\\u2013 \\u201cyou can\\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\\u201d But women still\\u2013 \\u201cyeah. I\\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\\u201d What are you, nuts? \\u201cI\\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\\u201d \\u201cTo your death, statistically.\\u201d How do they still do it? If you\\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI hope this one\\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\\u2019t do what he\\u2019s going to do.\\u201d\\n\\u201cFirst Date\\u201d\\nI always\\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\\u2019s the first date \\u2019cause of the way they\\u2019re walking together And she\\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \\u201cwell\\u2026 \\u201cha ha! \\u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\\u2026\\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \\u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\\u2019s like, \\u201cthat was good. He\\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\\u201d And he has no idea. He\\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\\u2019s already in there.\\n\\u201cTits\\u201d\\nGuys are\\u2013 We love women a lot\\u2013 all men do\\u2013 And we just look at you. That\\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Like they\\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \\u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\\u2013 \\u201cdon\\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \\u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\\u201d And 100% of us will go, \\u201cyes, of course.\\u201d That doesn\\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \\u201cyeah. Ok.\\u201d Beep! \\u201cdon\\u2019t worry. He\\u2019s not your tits. Don\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\\u2019t usually\\u2013 You don\\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\\u2019s tit. \\u201cthank you, Deborah. I\\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\\u201d It\\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d Which I don\\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\\u2019t know if you read \\u201cthe grapes of wrath,\\u201d But that\\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\\u2019re like, \\u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d There\\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\\u2013 \\u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\\u201d \\u201choly moly with that!\\u201d \\u201cthe end.\\u201d \\u201cmy god! \\u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\\u2013 And you\\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \\u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\\u2026 \\u201cit\\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \\u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\\u201d That\\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\\u2019s, once you\\u2019re on one\\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\\u2019t get the second one. \\u201cyeah, it\\u2019s like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit.\\u201d \\u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \\u201cthat\\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \\u201cI like your mom\\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\\u201d And if it\\u2019s up to the guy, we\\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \\u201cyou know what? \\u201cI\\u2019m good with the one. That\\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\\u201d We\\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\\u2013 \\u201cyeah\\u2013\\u201d \\u201cthere\\u2019s a bomb!\\u201d \\u201cshit! Come on, let\\u2019s get\\u2013 \\u201ccome on! Let\\u2019s get your tits out of here!\\u201d\\n\\u201cDivorce\\u201d\\nI\\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\\u2019ve seen\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 48 maybe. I don\\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\\u2019m not saying don\\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\\u2019s the best part. It\\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \\u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\\u2019s over. I can\\u2019t take it.\\u201d And again, if you\\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\\u2019s just a fact. I\\u2019m sorry. I\\u2019m sorry, but it\\u2019s true. Everything\\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\\u2019m a good father. I\\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \\u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\\u2019s like every parent\\u2019s fantasy. Who can\\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \\u201cgood-bye, girls. \\u201cDaddy\\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\\u201d That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m such a good dad.\\n\\u201cVideoing Your Kids\\u201d\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\\u2019s there, and everybody\\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \\u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\\u2013 There\\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\\u2019s happening ten feet\\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \\u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \\u201cmy god! \\u201cit\\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\\u201d And guess what? They\\u2019re not watching it, either. They\\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \\u201cthat\\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\\u201d Nobody\\u2019s watching your kids\\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \\u201cThat\\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\\u201d\\n\\u201cLife Is A Good Deal\\u201d\\nDon\\u2019t tape shit on your\\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \\u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\\u2019s an ama\\u2013 Here\\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\\u2013my god\\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \\u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\\u2019t matter who\\u2019s president or anything, You just\\u2013\\u201c\\u201d Every time I\\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \\u201cI could die right now,\\u201d and I mean it! That\\u2019s how good life is. You get to\\u2013 you get to fuck. That\\u2019s free if you\\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\\u2019s your buddy. If you\\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\\u2019re doing, and\\u2026 It\\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \\u201cto kill a mockingbird.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\\u2019m not worried about it ending.\\n\\u201cBehind The Wheel\\u201d\\nIt\\u2019s pretty good, and I\\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\\u2019t know. You know, it\\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\\u2019re driving, That\\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \\u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\\u2013I don\\u2019t know\\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \\u201cworthless piece of shit.\\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \\u201cWorthless piece of shit\\u201d? That\\u2019s somebody\\u2019s son. And things I\\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\\u2013 I don\\u2019t remember, even\\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \\u201chey, fuck you!\\u201d? \\u201cworthless piece of shit!\\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d I said that to a person. \\u201cI hope you die!\\u201d Why? \\u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\\u2019d like to think that I\\u2019m a nice person, But I don\\u2019t know, man.\\n\\u201cIf Murder Was Legal\\u201d\\nA lot of it is context. There\\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019d love to think, \\u201cI would never do that,\\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\\u2019d like to think it\\u2019s \\u2019cause, Like, \\u201cI would never do that.\\u201d No. It\\u2019s \\u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\\u2013 \\u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\\u2019t trust somebody who didn\\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\\u2019t like them. \\u201cI never killed anybody.\\u201d \\u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \\u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\\u201d \\u201cI think he\\u2019s nice.\\u201d \\u201cshut up, Janet.\\u201d They would just\\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\\u2019d go to a mall, there\\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\\u2013 \\u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\\u2019t listen to me!\\u201d Just\\u2013pbbt! There\\u2019d be just\\u2013 You\\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \\u201cyou have to clean up your kids \\u201cwhen you kill them \\u2019cause it\\u2019s gross. \\u201cit\\u2019s bad for the environment. \\u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \\u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \\u201cevery three feet of America. \\u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \\u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \\u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \\u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \\u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n\\u201cOf Course, But Maybe\\u201d\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\\u2013 That\\u2019s the thing I believe\\u2013 and then there\\u2019s this thing, and I don\\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \\u201cof course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026\\u201d I\\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\\u2019s happened\\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\\u2026 But maybe\\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \\u201chow did they build those pyramids?\\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \\u2019em up and didn\\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \\u2019cause it\\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\\u2019re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

throw the peace sign afterwards and there would that snailtrail between your fingers god was juicy you could just blow bubble wand with just slime you slime you ghostbustersi dont know what kind mother gonna – and did have get little bit science involved when trying get pregnant and lot that most likely fault because when was ate plan like skittles uterus probably looked like smokers lung and found out that progesterone levels were alarmingly low then had take these hormone pills that were suppositories and push pop them myself every single night and then writing job fresh off the boat would storyboarding front coworkers and then some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into underwear and had act like everything was when everything was clearly not and then side effect the progesterone was that made extremely itchy then had find ways discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge immediately smell fingers afterwards want able smell fingers when wanna smell own goddamn fingers housewives they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make sandwich mmm they watch property brothers scratch whats crackin mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about when can smell fingers when can smell fingers when can discretely find way smell fingers nature made you urgently curious protect you cause you gotta check that its all good the hood its too funky you need see doctor your fingers are your first webmdwhen husband and were trying have kid lot people were like god thats hot you guys doin lot fuckin dude thats– thats shit you your when – when youre your and youve been trying get pregnant for while gets very clinical you pee these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin tells you when its easter time and would only fuck him when was easter time was like only four days out the month and outside that would like were not fuckin need you save want your sperm pentup and angry and rapey possible that when they come out its like release the kraken and they just come out like bunch angry refugees escaping dictatorship you know and yeah and most the time like wouldnt even have sex cause was tired when would come home and see the smiley face the ovulation strip and like its time and would just give husband hand job most the time and would close his eyes immediately know what that means when somebody closes their eyes during sex its not because theyre such ecstasy with you that– that they need close their eyes when somebody closes their eyes during sex its because theyre literally trying shut the image your face out their head and instead project two latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day redtube onto the back their eyelids which fine because then doesnt have see the expression face that says please hurry the fuck and then when was about finish could always tell because the indication very universal when man about finish its when they get that that stupidass look their face where they look like they just got bit zombie just and then because were hippies like hey hey please look the eye and remember come with intention and then would jump him and hold onto his neck and would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out him and some this shit that learned atlanta and then would turn upside down immediately afterwards make sure all that harvard nectar would just drain inside thats right cause dont wanna work anymoreim very grateful pregnant and this far along seven and half months pregnant because last year had miscarriage which very common and lot women who are their flip out when they hear that theyre like god thats dark and terrible cant believe that girl when youre youll know plenty women who have had miscarriage

then she said but what dont see heartbeat and was like yes the lord mysterious dont feel bad they were the size poppy seeds ive picked boogers larger than the twins that lost and most women wont let their husbands watch when theyre going through miscarriage sat husband down front while sat the toilet and was like you look you watch the whole thing and felt bad for and used leverage and held that shit over his head for month and got him whatever the fuck wanted him for days took see beyoncé bought bike off craigslist thats miscarriage bike and love very much for days finally had the marriage always wantedim scared about giving childbirth though – very very scared childbirth thats why going hire doula you know what that you know what doula thats white hippie witch that blows quinoa into
